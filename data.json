Often praised as an otherworldly angel, Jónsi in fact does strike a lot like one because of his angelic falsetto voice.\n      Jónsi is the front man of the Icelandic post rock band Sigur Rós whose music has achieved a jaw dropping success. Normally bands that sing in their own mother tongue have less chance of becoming known all around the world - Sigur Rós breaks that rule. Their gibberish sounding lyrics and soul grabbing, esthetic music has earned them a well deserved success.\n      Sigur Rós didn’t receive much attention until after 1999’s Ágætis byrjun. A British journalist described the album “like God weeping tears of gold in heaven.“ In 2002 the band released an untitled album in Hopelandic language (aka. glossolalia), that basically had no meaning and lyrics were not to be found anywhere. The idea behind was to make people interpret the music and sounds in their own way, write their own lyrics.\n      Jónsi has been involved in many music projects since the creation of Sigur Rós in 1992. 7 albums on his hand, collaborations with the movie industry resulting in several movie soundtracks, collaborations with his long term boyfriend Alex, as well as solo performances.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Misha Mansoor\n          Named as one of the next generation’s big six-string legends by Rolling Stone Magazine, Misha Mansoor is currently paving the way for the new era of progressive metal with his gut-punching riffs and keen ear for catchy melodies.\n      This heavy metal innovator is the founder and lead guitarist in modern progressive metal band, Periphery, which alongside Swedish rhythmic metal pioneers Meshuggah, are currently seen as the frontrunners of the “Djent”-movement. The sound was perfected on Periphery’s self-titled debut album from 2010, which he wrote, programmed, produced and mixed all by himself. Besides this his otherworldly guitar chops also appear on studio project Haunted Shores with fellow Periphery guitarist, Mark Holcomb.\n      Before Periphery’s rise to fame, Misha Mansoor ruled the internet under his online pseudonym, Bulb where he relentlessly churned out songs and demos for the metal-hungry crowd. This resulted in over 100 home-recorded demos and song ideas, and a vast knowledge about sounds and recording techniques.\n      Mansoor’s influences range from Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah to British guitar virtuosos Allan Holdsworth and Guthrie Govan to shred-legend John Petrucci of Dream Theatre. But a more surprising musical inspiration is the Japanese pianist and composer Nobuo Uematsu, who is known for his insane sense of melodies and beautiful arrangements in the Final Fantasy video game series.\n      Mansoor is a self-proclaimed gear junky and is constantly on the lookout for new and interesting sounds that he can use in his compositions. Hence you’ll frequently catch him online talking about and discussing the gear that creates the unlimited sound image that is Misha Mansoor.\n      Misha has been a long-time TC Electronic fan, and has been using the original SCF Stereo Chorus pedal for years now. Recently the Flashback Delay and Ditto X2 Looper have made their way to his home studio and are great tools in his songwriting process. \n\n   ",

Inspired by Soundgarden who has been a major influence in the way Weinman thinks and writes music, he was lead down the rabbithole of musical wonderment. \n      While thrashing away on his guitar, Weinman attended Fairleigh Dickenson University in Madison and got himself a degree in psychology. Afterwards he studied Corporate Communications at FDU gaining knowledge on the business world. He is known for his outspoken views on the music industry and has spoken at universities and conferences on the subject of music production and the music business. \n      In 1997 Weinman founded the mathcore band the Dillinger Escape Plan. The band emerged from the hardcore punk trio Arcane and became The Dillinger Escape Plan - A reference to John Dillinger, the famous 1930s bank robber who managed to escape jail multiple times. The only remaining original member is Ben Weinman who is involved in the production of all their releases as well as the management of the band. \nThe band was renowned for their intense performances, which are increasingly wild and often violent. With elaborate performances as well as a creative and technical approach of their music the Dillinger Escape Plan has released five studio albums, been mentioned in mass media such as The Rolling Stones magazine and New York Times, had Billboard chart status and performances on television such as Late night with Conan O’Brien. \nIn 2009 they started their own label ‘Party Smasher’ and released their records through this.

Members of the supergroup are Brent Hinds (Mastodon), Jon Theodore (former The Mars Volta’s drummer) and Eric Avery (former Jane’s Addiction’s bassist).  \n      Weinman has over the past decade evolved into one of the finest writers of epic, multilayered, catchy-as-all-get hard rock.

I was bewitched by Jimmy Hendrix at a very young age. I was the youngest of seven kids, there were five girls in between, and my brother was the oldest and I was the youngest, so we had a room together, so I actually listened to all of his music growing up. He was heavy into Hendrix, Cream, the James Gang, The Beatles, The Stones…stuff….so Hendrix and Clapton, the Creamier Clapton, these guys were like gods to me when most people were into Kermit the Frog back home.”\n      Koch studied jazz guitar at the University of Wisconsin, and his Milwaukee-based band Greg Koch & the Tone Controls became one of the Wisconsin's most popular and acclaimed acts.\n      Playing in various bands, Koch eventually realized that he wanted to do his own songs. He got signed on Steve Vai’s label, Fender approached him with an offer to do Fender clinics, which would prove to be a match made in heaven due to Koch’s exquisite guitar chops and his unique sense of humor.\n      Koch has released several popular guitar method books and instructional DVDs for the Hal Leonard Corporation, including one on Koch’s own particular take on guitar called “Guitar Gristle”.\n      Most recent is Koch’s Strat’s Got Your Tongue release, an instrumental blues-based cd of world-class guitar.

This instrumental record covers a broad range of genres including fusion, rock, metal, and acoustic bluegrass. Andy Wood is known for blurring the lines of preconceived genres. Andy has toured as a guitarist for various acts, including Rascal Flatts (current) Sebastian Bach, Disciple, and Scott Stapp.\n      Andy spent most of his childhood playing and competing in bluegrass festivals. Touring the bluegrass circuit with his cousin and grandfather provided Andy with the necessary exposure that helped refine and sharpen his skills. Andy and his cousin held various state championship titles. At the young age of sixteen Andy finished second in the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MANDOLIN CONTEST in Winfield, Kansas. All of this was accomplished before Andy discovered the world of electric guitar at the age of eighteen.\nFast-forward a few years. Andy's curiosity and appreciation for music drew him into the world of electric guitars. The new instrument was familiar due to his experience with acoustic instruments, but at the same time, allowed him to manipulate his sound in ways never before possible. He began studying the styles of Nashville session players such as Brent Mason and Albert Lee.\nIt was not long after Andy had immersed himself in new styles such as jazz, swing, fusion, and rock. Andy began to study other guitar greats such as The Dixie Dregs, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai.  The young guitarist began incorporating their influences into his own style.\nAt the age of 22, Andy was drawn back to competition in the form of GUITARMAGGEDON, a guitar contest sponsored by Guitar Center. Andy was a face in the crowd of 3,400 other contestants, but he made his presence known by being crowned champion of this prestigious tournament.\nNot long after winning Guitarmaggedon, Andy became a founding member of the rock group DOWN FROM UP. They have toured with Seven Dust, Drowning Pool and 10 Years.\nAs Andy climbs to greater and greater heights, his technical proficiency and tasteful chops makes Mr. Wood a force to be reckoned with, and a name you will not forget.

            "desc": "About Dave Weiner\n          For the last 13 years, the only constant in Steve Vai’s touring career has been guitarist Dave Weiner.\n      Fresh out of college back in Pennsylvania with an Accounting degree, Dave moved to Los Angeles in 1998 to attend Musician’s Institute: Guitar Institute of Technology.\n      “No matter how many years of schooling I went through, after it was over, I always said I was heading to LA to go to GIT,” explains Dave. “Since I was 10 years old, I knew guitar was my calling… and school in sunny LA where I play guitar all day sounds like a great place to get something started.”\n      “I knew once I was in LA, I had to start meeting people.  I was at GIT to learn and play to get to a level where I could sustain a career playing music, but if I was the best at what I did and no one knew about it, what good is that?”\n      So, the first day of school, Dave found MI’s job board. “There were probably 50 pieces of paper stapled up on this board. I happened to find one that said ‘…small artist management firm seeks intern. Make your own hours…‘ I was interested in learning what a manager does and making my own hours was exactly what I needed to do. There were no names; just a fax number.  So I faxed my resume in. That night I got a call from a woman from the firm. We chatted and she eventually named her clients, the last of which was Steve Vai.  She asked if I knew who he was… of course.”\n \nSo Dave took the internship doing basic office tasks. “I’d get mail, lunch, process orders, etc. Very basic office stuff while I was observing and learning the day-to-days in a management firm. Once in a while I’d take some papers to Vai. Every time I met him he called me a different name, but at that point, that was fine with me. I’d correct him and just try to be professional”.\n      After a year at GIT, Dave was asked by some recording students if he’d be willing to perform a few songs for their final project and said \"sure\".  \"I told Vai I was going to be recording the demo. He said, ‘Cool, let me hear it when it’s done’.\"\n      Dave tracked the demo, gave it to Steve and didn’t hear anything about it. “I figured it was just put into the pile of countless other demos Vai gets.” Weeks went by until one Friday in September of 1999, the phone rings. It’s Vai, “…I really liked your demo. You can obviously play. I’m about to start rehearsals for a world tour, I could use another guitar player. Would you like to join the band?”\n      Forward to late 2000. One full world tour done, Dave’s got some time off before the next and decides it’s time to get things started with his own music. \"I was well received by the fans on the Vai tour, they were going to see me again, the market was right in front of my face.”\n      So Dave started writing his debut instrumental record Shove The Sun Aside, which was recorded in between tours during the following years and released in 2004, then rereleased in 2005 after being licensed to Vai’s label, Favored Nations. \n      Since then, Weiner has released two more albums and has toured the world several times with Steve Vai.\n\n   ",

After playing with The Polecats for 14 years he started playing with Morrissey, as well as functioning as musical director and co-writer on many of Morrissey’s songs.\n      Working with Morrissey is Boorer’s main gig, so his work with the Polecats and his solo career has to take a back seat most of the time. Yet, he has still managed to put out four albums with the Polecats, four solo albums, and numerous collaborations with other artists since he started working with Morrissey almost 25 years ago. So to call Boz a well-rounded musician must be seen as the understatement of the year!\nEven though fans of The Polecats may see Boorer as mainly a rockabilly guitarist, and probably wouldn’t have expected the work with Morrissey to be as successful as it has been, Boz himself have seen his relationship with Morrissey as a match made in music heaven from day one:\n“One thing I enjoy with Morrissey is that there are no real musical boundaries. There are no laws to how it’s supposed to be,” Boorer says, explaining why he’s never gotten bored working with the same man for so long. \n \nBoorer’s style can be hard to describe, because it varies so much depending on the song and who he’s playing with, but one common thread that weaves through everything is the confidence and competence of a true professional with nearly 4 decades at the top of his game.\nNot satisfied with being a versatile guitarist, Boorer also plays the clarinet, saxophone, bass, drums, and piano, and he produces for several up-and-coming indie bands in his studio in Portugal – you know, for variety.\n      Recently Boz integrated the Flashback Delay into his rig due to its… yeah, you guessed it… extreme versatility, letting him effortlessly adapt from playing with Morrissey to the crisp sound of the Polecats and the cornucopia of sounds and styles that make up his solo work.\n      Boorer’s latest solo album, Some Of The Parts, came out in 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, being hailed as one of the most varied albums in recent years.\nBoz Boorer has released 11 albums with The Polecats, eight albums with Morrissey and four solo albums. The first single from his fifth solo album is out now and the album is due out in 2015.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Niko Tsonev\n          Tsonev's guitar style is best described as a fusion of jazz, blues and rock covering a wide variety of playing techniques like the use of natural and artificial harmonics, wide interval arpeggios, whammy bar string bending, chordal two-hand tapping and creative use of effects.\n      Niko Tsonev is a Bulgarian-born virtuoso guitarist living in London, England. Starting music on the accordion at the age of four, Tsonev moved on to playing the guitar several years later. In his early teens, he started taking guitar and music theory lessons after becoming serious about making music. After relocating to London in 1996, Tsonev studied Music Production at Lewisham College and joined a musician session agency.\n      Tsonev has since continued to perform and record for artists and producers from very diverse stylistic backgrounds (Steven Wilson, JJ Grey, Youth, Digitonal, Aquilina and FabGrease Quentin), encompassing progressive rock, instrumental jazz fusion and blues through to urban and world music. His stylistic flexibility is showcased in his solo work and guitar playing style as well as his work as a film and TV composer.\n      The song Venetian Poison from Tsoney’s solo album, Nix Hydra, was released as a video, which lead to Niko being recommended to Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree. In early 2012, this lead to Niko Tsonev being invited to join the Steven Wilson Band.\n      This is how Niko describes his long relationship with TC Electronic…\nI’m at the cross point of where my session work helps my solo career as a guitarist releasing music that pushes the palette of the guitar genre. And I strive to do so at a higher level, to grow artistically as well as musically, to do things with the guitar which haven’t been done and focus on song writing depth and substance as much as on chops and technique, etc.\n      To be fair, my efforts as a solo guitar artist open more doors for great session gigs and I love doing it - keeps you on the edge - all these situations requiring musical stamina as well as great social skills. It's the best way to get better!\n      In terms of gear, I have used a lot of TC products over the years such as the M2000, M3000 and FireworX processors, but now I mainly use the G-System, both for effects, but also as an amp channel controller.\n      I still have to use different guitar rigs, though – they vary with the different gigs I do. Of course, everyone knows the G-System and the beauty there is in the consistency of the sounds. Your peripheral sounds-modulation/verbs/echos are there for you no matter what the amp is. And they are of top notch studio grade quality. So, in a scenario of having to deliver different type of overdriven sounds for different genres, I can easily patch in a different gain box to compliment a different amp or suit the gig better. It’s just enormously versatile.\n      Other than that, I use several compact pedals such as the PolyTune, Dark Matter, Corona chorus, FlashBack delay, Hall Of Fame reverb and Shaker vibrato, all mixed and matched for different gigs… and I use the TonePrint App, of course.\n      I can't describe how impressed I am with the TC line of stomp boxes! This format seems to never die - on the contrary! So if you are doing a small jazz or blues gig, you can bring a couple of stomp boxes, beam the most suitable TonePrints for tonight's material from your phone... Future-proof!\n\n   ",

This rockin’ guitarist began his musical journey at age 10, when he picked up a guitar for the very first time. By the time he turned 13 he semi-professionally partook in a cabaret band called “Contrast”. Later on he was playing all across South Wales in a band called Rocktopus and in the year of 1979 he formed the heavy metal band, Persian Risk.\n \nDuring a Hawkwind gig, at only 12 of age, Phil was lucky enough to get hold of Motörhead frontman Lemmy’s autograph. So, when Lemmy was holding auditions for a new Motörhead guitarist, due to the departure of Brian Robertson in 1983, Phil was destined to try-out. Although seeking out only one guitarist, upon discovering the roaring synergy between Phil and guitarist Michael “Würzel” Burston, Lemmy decided to keep them both – a Motörhead gang had yet again risen. To this day, Phil Campbell remains a member of Motörhead, in spite of a wide range of line up changes throughout the years.\n      Phil’s choice of guitars, when either playing live on stage or recording in the studio, often falls upon his LAG Explorer Signature model armed with two Seymour Duncan humbuckers or his Minarik Inferno Guitar. But his personal weaponry of thundering axes also features guitars such as a Parker Nitefly, a Claymore custom, guitars built by Luthier TC Ellis, guitars from Framus, DBZ, Caparison, Jackson, Kramer, ESP, PRS, DBZ and Charvel.\n      Phil is running his guitars through a range of effect pedals from TC as well, and we sat down with this legendary rock star to create a couple of TonePrints for some of his favourite sounds. Among others he created a thick psychedelic vibrato Hendrix-ish sound to jinx up the soul of his sound and a short delay kinda sound for those ravenously roaring guitar solos.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Harry McVeigh\n          Harry McVeigh lends his unspeakably precise vocals and invigorating guitar skills to British alternative rock band sensation, White Lies.\n      Formerly known as Fear of Flying, the band also consists of Charles Cave (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Jack Lawrence-Brown (drums) and is accompanied by Tommy Bowen (keyboards) during live performances. \n      White Lies formed in October 2007, when the three members realized their songs didn't fit the confines of their original pop band anymore. It was time for a new start and a darker sound that would reflect their maturity. The band was quite swift in making the change, by briefly announcing “Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!” on their MySpace page. At the time, McVeigh explained that due to the musical climate, they had to change their approach otherwise they would not have been kept by any record company. \n      The first contract the newly oriented trio landed was with Fiction Records and not before long their “debut” album, To Lose My Life (2009) beat off competition from Lady Gaga, The Script and Kings of Leon by reaching no. 1 in UK tops. \nSingles like \"Unfinished Business\" and \"Death\" with their organ synths and racing guitars led to popularity, tours and festival appearances in the United Kingdom and North America. In addition, the band was headlined at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend and got a place on the 2009 NME Awards Tour. Further singles \"To Lose My Life\" and \"Farewell to the Fairground\" brought on increased media attention and led to the band's first worldwide headline tour. Starting with 2009, White Lies featured in multiple \"ones to watch\" polls for the coming year, including the BBC's Sound of 2009 poll and the 2009 BRITs Critics' Choice Award.\n      Regarding White Lies' musical style, the media has drawn comparisons to Joy Division, Editors, Interpol and Echo & The Bunnymen. In response to this, McVeigh declared: \"We weren't alive during that period of music ... we've never really been that into Joy Division, especially not the Editors ... or even Interpol really\", adding \"I don't think our music sounds a whole lot like those comparisons, I think we're a lot more euphoric and uplifting\".\n      Indeed, their music has been dubbed as dark and brooding; meanwhile, the White Lies insist that their personalities are quite the opposite. 'We certainly explore a lot of dark themes but if anything we're quite grounded, happy, content people. And that's because we vent our emotions through music', McVeigh says.\n      The band has had immense success worldwide and has sold out tickets on each of their tours. They have also participated in numerous festivals among which Lollapalooza, Glastonbury, Roskilde, and Rock Werchter and as of January 2011 have a new album out, called Ritual. \nMcVeigh first thought of taking up the guitar while listening to Jimi Hendrix’ Voodoo Chile; “Like most guitarists I was inspired by the sound Jimi got out of a guitar. I bought a wah-wah pedal to help me play this but it sounded bad” McVeigh confesses. That was a long time ago and nowadays, Harry has chosen the TC Electronic G-System as his weapon of choice for his effects processing and is using it extensively during the band’s grueling tour schedules.   \n   ",

His galloping guitar-riffs, aggressive arpeggios and levitating legato runs can be heard on all of the group’s albums.\n      For more that 35 years Dave Murray has been one of the driving forces behind Iron Maiden - the group that in retrospect stands as pioneers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal - all the way from the time of their initial success in the early 1980s, over the classic years with \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Piece of Mind\", \"Powerslave\", \"Live After Death\" and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", to their latest album \"The Final Frontier\".\n      Dave's sound is highly recognizable, primarily based on the legato style solo variety. Through the years this has been a part of Maidens trademark sound and can be heard on songs all the way back from the first self-titled album, such as \"Phantom of the Opera\", to songs from \"The Final Frontier\".\n      Dave's mainstay guitar is a US Fender Stratocaster equipped with and a Floyd Rose tremolo system. He primarily uses Seymour Duncan Hot Rails and JB Jnr pickups. He gets his aggressively distorted sound from the Marshall EL34 100/100 Rack Mount Power Amp and a pair of 300w Marshall 1960-cabinets. In addition to this Murray uses the TC Electronic G-Force System live and in the studio - for that little extra something.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Michael 'Padge' Paget\n          Michael ’Padge’ Paget, born 1978, is the lead guitarist in Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine. The band is famous for their catchy vocals, aggressive riffs and haunting melodies. Padge gets his inspiration from heavy players like James Hetfield and Dimebag Darrell\n      Said to be the new heroes of guitar bands, up there with Metallica and the like, Welsh metalheads Bullet For My Valentine is enjoying international success with sold-out headline tours in Europe, US, Australia and Japan. Simultaneous Top 5 chart entries for their latest album \"Scream Aim Fire\" are popping up across the globe. \"Scream Aim Fire\" sold 53,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n      Combining a modern approach to metalcore and emo ballads with old-school 80s metal virtues, lead guitarist Michael “Padge” Paget lets his G-System handle the effects management while he’s busy handling the uptempo riffing and harmonic shredding mayhem. Just home for a few days after an extensive Euro/US tour only to take off for Australia and Japan shortly after, the obvious focus of this interview is how his G-System performed on the recent tour. “Well, nothing short of brilliantly” is Michael’s blunt reply to that question, followed up by “no problems whatsoever.” This comes from a guitarist that hadn’t had his G-System more than a couple of weeks before taking off on tour.\n      Pedalboard trimmed down\nBefore turning to the G-System, Michael had a huge board packed with pedals, separate delay pedals for different delay types and decay times etc. And with two amps to select channels on and switch between for dirty and clean sounds generating the array of dynamics and intensity shifts that make up the signature of Bullet For My Valentine’s hard-edged music, there’s plenty of need for the control and effects management that G-System provides. “I spent more time tap dancing than I did playing guitar,” Michael recalls. “G-System has really simplified things. It allows me focus my energy on playing rather than constantly being distracted by having to worry about which pedals to apply next – now one button gets the job done,” he continues.\n      Once connected to the G-System relay connectors, switching channels on your amp is pedal simple: All you have to do is dial in the desired channel just like any other parameter setting you want to store in the preset bank that holds up to 200 user presets.\nLess is more\nBesides having G-System simplifying his setup, with the insane range of different stompboxes out of his signal chain, Michael has also experienced a remarkable sound improvement; “It may appear to be a hackneyed phrase, but less pedals in your signal chain clearly equals less signal loss and less noise” Michael declares with true conviction in his voice. \n      However, noise elimination alone doesn’t do the trick. What really makes G-System shine is its unsurpassed sound quality. Michael elaborates on his choice: “There’s just no getting around the fact that TC offers the ultimate delays and reverbs. Delay is my favorite G-System effect, but I also use its compressor to color my sound and add uniqueness”.\n      Drag-and-drop easy preset sharing\nUsually, guitar virtuosity goes hand in hand with gear nerdry. Not so with Michael. Being one helluva guitar player he is surprisingly indifferent to the technical side of things as long as he’s got premium sound. \n“I’m really not much of a gear nerd,” Michael says. “I have Kevin, my guitar tech, set it all up, doing the programming and stuff. Cool thing; when we hit the US leg of our recent tour, I was really amazed with how easy it was to just copy the settings from my European G-System preset bank to the US board which the backline rental company had ready for us when we arrived.” Thanks to the G-System Editor, aligning presets between two units has become drag-and-drop easy. This is not just convenient to meet increasing weight restrictions on most airlines, it is also pretty neat when you want to exchange great presets with your friends or when you want to get the tone of your favorite guitarist.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Paul Gilbert\n          Paul Brandon Gilbert is known for his technical guitar work with Racer X and Mr. Big. He has been voted number 4 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the \"Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time\", and holds a spot in Guitar Worlds 50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time list.\n      Ambitious at an early age, around 1981-82 Paul contacted Mike Varney, founder of Shrapnel Records, asking for a gig with Ozzy Osbourne. At that time, Varney couldn't think why Osbourne would want a 15 year old guitarist, but after listening to Paul demo he changed his mind. In 1982, fifteen year-old Paul Gilbert appeared in Guitar Player magazine for the first time, holding a homemade Flying V in his hands, and proclaiming his style to be \"Heavy Metal.\"\n      By the age of 18 he had moved to Hollywood, California, won the Los Angeles “Guitar Wars” contest, graduated from G.I.T. (The Guitar Institute of Technology), and started teaching there as G.I.T.s youngest instructor. At 19, Paul formed the now-legendary shred-metal band RACER X, and recorded his first album with the group. \n      RACER X soon became kings of the Los Angeles club scene, and continued to record melodic, yet intimidating metal music, including the instrumental classic, “Scarified”. Gilbert left Racer X in 1988, but ten years later he contacted the members of Racer X for a reunion. In 1999, the band recorded the album, Technical Difficulties, which went gold in Japan.\n \nAt 21, one of Paul's musical heroes, bassist Billy Sheehan (Talas, David Lee Roth) asked him to join him to form a new band. This band became MR. BIG. Together with vocalist Eric Martin and drummer Pat Torpey, MR. BIG went on to make many classic albums, combining elements of rock, metal, pop, soul, and shred. While in MR. BIG, Paul enjoyed the success of the number 1 hit single “To Be With You”, and the opportunity to perform in sold-out arenas all over the world. Gilbert continued playing in Mr. Big in the 1990s. During that time he became famous for using a Makita cordless drill with three picks mounted on the end of it, which he used most famously on the Mr. Big track ‘Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little boy’. \n      At 30, Paul felt the urge to take complete control over his musical direction, and left MR. BIG to pursue a solo career. Since then, he has recorded over 20 albums of high-energy guitar rock. Sometimes with vocals, sometimes instrumental, sometimes with his mates from RACER X, and sometimes in collaboration with his uncle, Jimi Kidd, singer/guitarist Freddie Nelson, or with drummer Mike Portnoy.\n      Apart from being a touring and recording musician Paul is also the most sought-after and YouTube’d guitar instructor of his time. Paul's instructional DVDs and magazine columns have become Shred Encyclopedias for a new generation of guitarists. Listen to any fast metal guitar player today, and you're sure to hear some phrases borrowed from Paul's “Intense Rock” DVD.\n      In 2007, Paul joined guitar legends Joe Satriani and John Petrucci for the “G3” tour of North America. In the years since, Paul has performed over 250 shows with his band in Europe, Japan, and America.\n      Paul's recent touring and recording with MR. BIG has put him once again at the forefront of today's guitar scene. Paul now enjoys playing shows at the sold-out Budokan arena in Japan, rocking out for massive audiences at European rock festivals like Download, Gods of Metal, and Sweden Rock, or headlining for thousands of fans in South America, the USA, Indonesia, and Russia.\n   ",

Much more. Naturally cool, Paul is genuinely passionate about music. He plays in several bands, has covered every genre from rock to country and back and is often happiest at home, spending time with his wife, new born daughter and his three dogs. Who show surprisingly little interest in gear.\n      Paul's been with Guitar World for 15 years and he started out as a production coordinator. The gods of rock took a liking to him and next thing he knows, he's out doing videos. Paul is one of those guitarists that loves playing. While gear means a lot to him and he considers himself a gear head - he's more into playing and pure, undiluted tone. \n      One of the coolest things Paul said was that over the years, he went from owning just about all the gear on the planet, to actually scaling down to what sounds the best, and the essential tools he need to get a certain job done. This has helped him keep a really open mind as a tech editor and allowed him to understand that while some gear may not be right for his style of playing, it might work great\nfor players in a particular genre.\n      Paul's however avoided the trap most people fall into when working in the music business: they get cynical about gear. This is not what Paul's about at all, he still gets genuinely excited about new gear and guitars - and we still love his vids!\n      When Paul visited TC, his immense knowledge of gear, passion for tone and music and genuine 'coolness' were immediately appearant, and his TonePrints represent all these elements perfectly.\n      Currently, Paul plays in a country band called Radio Nashville, and uses the following TC products for his rig: Flashback X4, Flashback, Spark\nBoost and PolyTune Mini.\n   ",

Ever since 2000 he has been rocking in the band Stone Sour adding his passion of thrash metal to the group’s sound.\n      Apart from being an excellent guitarist Josh Rand is a talented songwriter. Experimenting with different effects is a catalyst for his writing and TC pedals are his go-to effects for spitting out killer songs. His first acquaintance with TC pedals was an article in Guitar World and he soon bought a bunch of them from Sweetwater. Rand is most thrilled about the TonePrint technology. The mind-blowing ability to fine-tune his settings or to beam someone else’s without any trouble is a feature he couldn’t find elsewhere.\n      Rand is born in Iowa on the south side of Des Moines. He began playing bass guitar when he was 15, the same year he met Corey Taylor (vocalist in slipknot and founder of Stone Sour) whom he later rocked with. Billy Sheehan, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted have been great inspirations to Josh. \nAfter two years of playing bass guitar he switched to guitar and found this to be his true calling. He earned a professional certificate in guitar from Berklee College of Music and is currently pursuing a master’s certificate. \n      In 2000 Josh crossed paths with Corey Taylor and restored the hard rock band Stone Sour - named after a drink consisting of whiskey and orange juice. The restored Stone Sour came out with their first album in 2002 including the song “Bother” which featured in the Spider-Man soundtrack. This album was RIAA certified with gold. Although Stone Sour’s musical style reflects hard rock, Rand tries to implement an aspect of metal and thrash metal elements into the music. His passion for trash metal goes way back to his early days. Since then Stone Sour has released 5 albums with more than 5 million records sold worldwide. On top of that they have earned 3 Grammy nominations and other awards. Rumor has it that Stone Sour will release a cover EP in 2015. \n      In 2013 Josh Rand released the DVD “The sound and the story”, an instructional DVD taking the viewer behind the scenes of Josh Rand himself. The DVD consists of an exciting story about Rand and his music filled with guitar content, lessons, exercises, interviews, gear tours and much more.\n   ",

Born into a Mormon family he regularly attended church growing up. He began his musical career on the piano, tried out drums but ended up falling in love with playing guitar.\n      As a teenager Valentine played in different bands in Lincoln before becoming a member of Square (former known as Happy Dog). He digs jazz and fusion, but for some reason he has always played in rock-oriented bands. \nIn 2000 Valentine uprooted and moved to LA, California with his band Square and here he met the members of Kara’s Flowers. Kara’s flowers needed a guitarist and a new beginning and Valentine was the perfect fit. A new beginning equals a new name and Kara’s Flowers became the well-known pop/rock band Maroon 5, with Valentine as lead guitarist and songwriter. \n      In 1996 Valentine took a one-week guitar session at Berklee College of Music where he became friends with John Mayer. The two kept in touch and Maroon 5 first got on the radar when they had an opening slot for John Mayer. From there it was fast forward for the band. With their debut album ‘Songs About Jane’ going worldwide and extensively touring they reached a high level of success. With 5 studio albums, 3 live albums, singles and numerous awards, Maroon 5 has established their presence being as cool as they come. \nThe band evolves from album to album and finds inspiration from current trends implementing these into their music. They enjoy experimenting with music and styles in order to develop new tunes.                    \n      Besides providing Maroon 5 with killer riffs Valentine also plays in a band named JJAMZ - Awkward to pronounce but its members are all musical geniuses. The band was started at a karaoke night at Guys in Hollywood. JJAMZ is made up from the first letter of each members name; James Valentine, Jason Boesel (Rilo Kiley/Conor Oberst), Alex Greenwald (Phantom Planet), Michael Runion (solo), and Z Berg (The Like). \n      He loves making music and truly has a gift for it.\n\n   ",

And although Jeff Walker’s tongue-twisting vocals are prominent on their records, it’s not really Carcass until Bill Steer picks up the guitar.\n      His down-tuned death’n’roll riffs always add a great deal of depth to the band’s sound and where other lead-guitarist sometimes come across as forced in their melodies, Steer always ends up with an extremely vicious yet human tone.\n      Much the same can be said of his purebred bite and pinpoint soloing with Gentlemans Pistols and his ferocious crunch with the criminally underrated blues-rock trio Firebird. When in his playful corner, Steer always brings the best of heavy metal classicism to any stage and studio.\n      After ten years of down-tuned grind, Carcass went on an extended hiatus from 96 until their return to recording with 2013’s Surgical Steel.\n      As hoped, the long-awaited album took the weight of anticipation by the scruff of the neck and tore it apart, limb from limb, resulting in one of the greatest reunion albums of all time.\n      Since their rebirth, Carcass has headlined metal festivals all over the world and is quietly (as quiet as Carcass gets) working on new material that might become the heavy filth of another cornerstone album in metal.\n\n   ",

But since every kid needs to go through a stage of rebellion, all Jake had to rebel against was music. Although he tried to push music aside, the guitar was destined to get a hold of him sooner or later. And when it did it got him good!\n      He started out listening to the raw and catchy riffs of Nirvana and Blink-182 and immediately began learning them on the guitar. But riffs quickly turned to intricate melodies, which led to scales, theory and a profound interest in jazz music.\n      He started taking lessons from a local jazz guitarist, and from that point on there was no going back. All he wanted to do was go all-in on music!\n      Hard work and an ambitious mind-set led young Jake to be accepted into the world-renowned Berklee College of Music in Boston, which has seen artists such as John Mayer, Steve Vai, John Scofield and John Petrucci walk the halls throughout the years.\n \nJake ended up completing his degree back home in England at the University of Surrey, where he began studying for a PhD in Classical Composition, while working as an associate lecturer in the fields of orchestration, jazz studies, performance and composition.\n      Jake’s unpolluted love for music sees him play a vast array of genres live every day. One day you’ll catch him playing eclectic fusion, the next he’s unleashing a heart-felt blues-rock attack, and the third you’ll catch him comping and laying down melodic phrases at jazz clubs across the country.\n      At the same time Jake has maintained a solid career as a classical composer, and his work has regularly been performed by world-class musicians.\n \nWe’re almost getting short of breath just by listing Jake Willson’s accomplishments so far, but luckily the man himself is unaffected and is currently pouring his heart and soul into his first solo album.\n      The future is certainly looking bright for this incredible six-string talent.\n   ",

He then left again in 2005, but returned for the second leg of Cradle of Filth's 2009 European Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder tour. Just in time to contribute to the album 'Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa'.\n      When Cradle of Filth is not touring or recording, McIlroy plays in his own bands Chaosanct, Order of Apollyon and NFD. He is currently working on Chaosanct's debut album as well as new material for all bands.\n      James first heard about TC through word of mouth. \"Literally every guitarist and gear head I knew would be salivating over the TC rack units, and it was just a case of taking the advice of a lot of people who were obsessed with their tone. I then read a lot about effects processors, and without a doubt the #1 company on everyone's lips was TC Electronics, so I decided to grab myself a G-Major.\" \n      \"For me, the attraction was the transparency, the ease of use, and little things such as worldwide voltage, ability to do external switching and all the nice little extras TC throw in on their products! Once I'd used it, there was no going back, it was an astounding piece of kit, gorgeous effects, easy to program and as a result TC Electronics has been the heart of my effects in every rig I have had for the past decade!\"\n      \"I use a TC rack effects processor in the FX loop of my amps in conjunction with midi based amp switchers and loopers. This way I have total control over effects, ordering and amp switching all from one board eliminating the hassle of tap dancing! For me, it just changed the way I thought about gear, I abandoned all processors which were trying to do too much, and it really pushed me down the path of getting as pure an amp tone as possible. With the TC quality I've always been completely confident that my amp's sound is shining through, with the effects being the icing on the cake!\"\n      \"I find the TC stuff has lots of little extras. For instance, the G-major I started on had a switch out that allowed me to control jack switchable devices (such as channel switching a head). Other things like easily being able to set input levels, adjust the output, being able to match the input sensitivity to the amp as well as quickly being able to add and edit effects.\"\n      \"TC stuff is just easy and simple to use, with a great user interface that is self-explanatory and natural. I've never needed a manual to use it, and thus a manual has never gotten between me and my creativity!\"\n\n   ",

            "desc": "About Dweezil Zappa\n          Dweezil Zappa is the son of Frank Zappa, so it was inevitable that from the moment of his birth, his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as “musician” on Dweezil’s birth certificate). \n      Dweezil’s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight, something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family.\n      Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers, it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old, he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.\n      Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil‘s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. \n      He listened to their records for hours on end trying to figure out a way to translate what he was hearing in his head to his fingers at the other end of the guitar. Along the way, he had opportunities to ask his dad for some help, but to gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales, Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai.\n      \"Steve made a notebook, which I still have, of scales and exercises and I practiced the stuff from that book at least 5 hours a day.\" \n      Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. In 1982, at the age of 12, he made his first onstage appearance with his father’s band at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. \"That was a great experience. I was so excited to have been asked to play, but I was incredibly nervous. Since I could only really play lead in the key of A, Frank devised a hand signal for the band to modulate the song 'Stevie's Spanking' down to A from its original key of B. After I finished my solo, he gave the cue for the band to modulate back up. It was so cool how he had so much control over the music, it almost seemed like a magic trick to me. It made a big impression on me and has stuck with me my whole life.\" Later that year, Dweezil recorded his first single, “My Mother Is A Space Cadet”, released on Frank Zappa’s Barking Pumpkin label and produced by non other than Edward Van Halen.\n      Since 2006, Dweezil has been touring with his father's music under the name 'Zappa Plays Zappa' with an impressive list of band members and guest musicians.\n\n   ",

But what started out as a love for classic rock quickly turned to a passion for country after being invited to sit in with a local Nashville band during a live gig at the age of 14. That was the first time he ever played a Telecaster, and the experience of playing the Tele for the first time and playing that kind of music just resonated deeply with him.

He is best known for being one of the lead guitarists for hard-rock gods Guns ‘n’ Roses.\n      Ron Thal, aka Bumblefoot, started playing the guitar at age 6 after hearing the Kiss Alive! album. That was some 35 years ago, and since then, he just continued to play, start bands, write music, make demos, play gigs, teach, build his own guitars, engineer and produce other bands. In fact, he has been releasing music for 20 years, and he is now one of the guitarists in the legendary rock band Guns N’ Roses.\n      “When I’m touring with Guns N’ Roses, I use my trusty Nova System for all my guitar effects. In fact, the only additional piece of effects gear I use is a wah-pedal,” Ron says. “When I was preparing for the Guns N’ Roses tour in 2009, I set out to build the ultimate FX-board, so I tried out every stomp-box and multi-FX board i could get my hands on over a couple of months, and it turned out that Nova System had exactly what I wanted and needed. Also, Nova System hasn’t changed the way I work, and that’s a huge compliment! In the past, I was using digital amps with built-in effects, and I was constantly changing all my gear. Then, I switched to tube amps and needed something that would give me all the effects I was used to with easy access. Fortunately, I was able to adapt to the Nova System very quickly. No awkward adjustments, so I was able to get right back to doing what I do. I plug into the amp, have a wah-pedal and the Nova System in the FX Loop of the amp, a MIDI floorboard to switch presets and an expression pedal connected. That's it!”\n“The one thing I like the most? It was Nova System’s compressor that won me over. You can get the release to snap back at such a fast rate – faster than any other gear I checked out. None of the other analog or digital stomp-boxes or multi-FX rack gear had the control like Nova System. Instead of using the 'Boost' button for solos, I like to boost by hitting the compressor. With a little gain and a very fast attack and release, all the notes are pulled forward and more 'in your face'. It's great for keeping consistent levels between picking and tapping, especially with Guns N’ Roses where there's three guitarists, bass, two keyboardists, drums, vocals, loops, etc... When it's my turn to step forward, Nova System makes it happen.”\nRon 'Bumblefoot' Thal's Guns N' Roses effects rig!\n      “As for my approach to playing, writing and producing music, it’s really pretty simple: Don't overthink it. Whatever you’re working on – songwriting, gigging, laying guitar tracks, mixing a song – trust your instincts, trust your gut. It's so easy to think yourself into an unproductive mental place, don't take it that far – if it sounds good, if it feels right, go with it!” \n   ",

Through his career he has play with some of the worlds most prominent jazz musicians and released a dozen solo albums. At age 60 Stern doesn’t seem to be slowing down.\n      After ending his studies at Berklee College of Music, Stern landed a gig with Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1976 and remained with the band for two years, appearing on the albums “More Than Ever” and “Brand New Day” before joining Billy Cobham's fusion band. Two years later he joined Miles Davis group, making his public debut on June 27, 1981, at the KIX nightclub in Boston, a performance documented on the CBS live album “We Want Miles”. He remained with Davis through 1983. From 1983 to 1984 he toured in Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth band and in 1985 he returned to Davis for a second tour of duty that lasted close to a year.\n      His solo debut, Upside Downside, was released on Atlantic Records in 1986. It features performances by Pastorius, David Sanborn, and Bob Berg. From 1986 through 1988, he was a member of Michael Brecker's quintet, appearing on “Don't Try This At Home”. After releasing “Time in Place” (1988) and “Odds or Evens” (1991) Stern joined the Brecker Brothers Band in 1992, becoming a factor in the success of the popular group for the next two years.\nFollowing this Stern went on to release two solo albums “Is What It Is” (1994) and “Between The Lines” (1996) - both of which received Grammy nominations. \nAfter 15 years with Atlantic, Stern shifted to ESC for the 2004 release of “These Times”, including guest appearances by bassist Richard Bona, saxophonist Kenny Garrett, and banjoist Bela Fleck. In August 2009, Stern released Big Neighborhood, which was nominated a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.\n      Equipment:\n      The axe that got away for Stern, was a hybrid 1950s/1960s Fender Telecaster, which was stolen from him in an armed robbery in Boston. This guitar is the basis for Sterns custom guitar build by Michael Aronson - a Telecaster style body with an original 1950's Broadcaster neck – equipped with Seymour Duncan and Bill Lawrence pickups. Stern plays this through a pair of Fender '65 Twin Reverb amps or the Yamaha G100-212 combo. Stern is a heavy user of chorus and delay effects that makes his sounds range from subtly swirling to positively psychedelic.\n\n   ",

However, it was not before he graduated from college that he first assembled a band together with his buddy Scott Stapp. The band known under the name of Creed achieved international success and recognition.\n \nAbout Creed:\n \nTremonti and Stapp are co-founding members of this American band, with the addition of a drummer Scott Phillips and bassist Brian Marshal. Creed managed to reach international success and became the first band that accomplished such a success with only a debut album. In 2004 Creed announced that the band was splitting up. Scott Stapp went on to pursue a solo career, while the rest of the band assembled a new group called Alter Bridge.\n \nAbout Alter Bridge:\n \nThe new-formed band invited Myles Kennedy to be the lead singer. Alter Bridge embarked on a successful journey to success and released 3 critically acclaimed albums. The 4th album is to be released in 2013.\n \nTremonti always wanted to go a bit “heavier“ with the guitar sounds, but he could never truly do it because it was not the sound of Creed or Alter Bridge. Hence Mark started developing the idea of solo album, where he could pursue his “heavier-sounding thrash metal like“ sound. His debut solo album “All I Was“ occupied the music stores in 2012 with Tremonti conducting the whole parade this time.\n \nThe album does not only reflect the different musical side of Mark, but also reveals him as a human being, where he sings about love, betrayal and isolation, more than ever before.\n   ",

James “Munky” Shaffer is one hard-hitting guitarist that plays the strings in powerful Korn and we are very excited that Shaffer uses our TC gear to spike his sound on- and off stage.\n      Shaffer started playing guitar at the age of 13, when he injured his left index finger and the doctors suggested that he should do something to rehabilitate his finger. He picked up the guitar. Shaffer started his career in the American metal band L.A.P.D, but after releasing two albums the band decided to pull the plug. This was the beginning of the band, which later became known as Korn. \n      Korn was formed in 1993 and their music is categorized as nu metal - a fusion genre that combines heavy metal with other genres like hip hop. When you hear Korn’s tunes you are instantly hit by an overwhelming strength and power, mixed with catchy songs that entertain the listener. In 1996, Korn got their mainstream breakthrough with their second album ‘Follow the Leader’ that peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998. Korn has sold 16 million albums in the US and over 60 million albums worldwide. But that’s not all: ten of the band's official releases have peaked the top ten of the Billboard 200 and eight of them were within the top five. Furthermore, they have received two Grammy Awards for hits ‘Freak on a Leash’ and ‘Here to Stay’. \n      Shaffer gets his inspiration from shredding guitarists as Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads and we are proud that he has selected our gear to be a part of his rig when he plays on major venues around the world.\n   ",

He has worked with the crème de la crème of well-known artists, and reigns the world of both bebop, jazz fusion, funk, blues, soul, rock and many other forms of modern music.\n      Scofield’s interest in music initially began when his family moved to the small suburban locations of Wilton, Connecticut. He attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and when he eventually left school he started recording with Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan. In 1976, after two years of performing and recording with the Billy Cobham/George Duke band, he replaced Pat Matheny in Gary Burton’s quartet. In autumn 1976, he signed a contract with Enja Records and released his first album, ‘John Scofield’, in 1977 – the first of many records to come.\n      Ever since the beginning of his musical journey, Scofield has been collaborating with legendary musicians such as Miles Davis, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson, Charles Mingus, Joe Defrancesco, Herbie Hancock, Pat Matheny, Bill Frisell, Pat Martino, Mavis Staples, Phil Lesh, Billy Cobham, Medeski Martin & Wood, George Duke, Jaco Pastorius, John Mayer and many more. He has been leading his own groups in the international jazz scene as well, and his discography holds a vast repertoire of over 30 different albums.\n      Touring approximately 200 days a year, John is armed with a very specific weaponry of instruments. Whether recording or performing live on stage, John always brings his personal rack of Ibanez guitars. He is an endorser of Ibanez, and he even based the Ibanez signature model, the JSM100, on his life-long brother in arms, the 1981 Ibanez AS200, which he believes to be one of the best semi-acoustics ever built.\n      John runs his guitars into a Pro Co RAT through Vox AC30 with top boost, and his arsenal of effect-stomp-boxes includes the awesome Hall of Fame Reverb TonePrint pedal from TC. Furthermore, he relies on the very cool TC PolyTune to always keep his guitars armed and ready.\n   ",

He has been a responsible for unforgettable hit songs such as 'Hemorrhage', 'Bad Day' and 'Shimmer'.\n      Brett Allen Scallions is an American musician from Brownsville, Tennessee. He is currently the lead singer and rhythm guitar player for the current lineup of multi platinum rock band Fuel, after being the vocalist for the original incarnation of the band from 1993 to 2005. Fuel burst onto the scene in mid-1998 with the release of \"Shimmer\" and slowly but surely built a following of fans. The band has released multiple albums including the double platinum Something Like Human. After Scallions left Fuel, he joined a band called The X's playing bass. The X's released one album before going on \"hiatus.\" He also recently joined Circus Diablo, a Los Angeles-based rock band while simultaneously playing with the X's. In March 2007, Scallions was selected as the singer for Riders on the Storm, a project featuring former The Doors members Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek. On March 9, 2010, the single \"Something to Believe\" by Hollow featuring Brett Scallions and Ken Wallace was released. In 2011 Fuel is re-formed again with vocalist Brett Scallions and it soon was made official that Brett and the members of Re-Fueled had become the new incarnation of Fuel. Outside Re-Fueled, Scallions has been busy with Sean Danielsen of Smile Empty Soul and producer Eddie Wall, writing and recording an album under the name World Fire Brigade – a much heavier act than Fuel, very deep and even growly at times. At NAMM 2011, Scallions stated that the World Fire Brigade album is due out this year. He also stated that World Fire Brigade would tour and play select shows. \n      When TC Electronic approached him to create his own unique TonePrints, Scallions was immediately onboard. He says, \"I have always loved TC Electronic stuff. They always make great stuff. Great pedals, great racks. I wanted to check these new pedals out as I was told you can save your settings and I was very intrigued by that.\" Scallions went on to create two of his own TonePrints called the Onion Delay and the Spring Onion.\n   ",

He has appeared on numerous recordings and has toured with some of the best musicians and artists such as Justin Hawkins, Love Shop, Gnags, Ida Corr, Mads Langer, Dicte and Claus Hempler to name a few.\n      Mika first picked up the instrument aged nine after hearing Jimi Hendrix on the radio. Technically he is now a virtuoso and has experience in many different musical styles and always shows his versatility as a musician and guitarist. When Mika's not playing with some of the most respected rock artists in Denmark, he's releasing his own material or writing music for TV.\n      Few guitarists can elicit the range of tones from their instrument as Mika Vandborg. It's easy to see why when you cast your eyes on the comprehensive pedalboard that gets barely a second's rest as Mika constantly drops effects in and out of the loop to add depth, power, grit and energy to his dynamic playing style.\n      Mika's attitude to playing is as uncompromising as his style of playing. \"Energy is my drive, that's what I'm always aiming for. The music has to touch you... or it's a waste of time.\"\n      To beat the range of tone from his guitars, Mika uses plenty of gear, both new and vintage, but one name that pops up again and again is TC Electronic. Mika grew up close to the TC Electronic HQ and knew people who worked there, so he got to try out all the good stuff. Mika's first TC product has since become a sought-after classic. \"My first machine was the 2290 delay, but I  unfortunately sold it in a moment of confusion! I had all the first editions of the Phaser, chorus/flanger, booster and so forth….\"\n      Fast forward to today and TC is still Mika's go-to brand for post-overdrive effects. \"I've got four or five set-ups and there is TC in all of them. I have an old G-Force in my rack set-up, it’s been there for 12 years and is still going strong. I now use a lot of stomp boxes from TC, my favorites are the Phaser Xii, Hall Of Fame Reverb, Shaker Vibrato, the Flashback X4 and the original Flashback. I have tons of great old tape echoes and other good stuff in my collection, but it's hard to bring on the road, and to tell you the truth, \"I can't hear the difference when I play\". The TonePrint series sound great and have made my life a lot easier. The tape echo in the Flashback is awesome!\"\n      \"TC gear is reliable, good sounding and I've had lots of inspiring hours with the TonePrint feature.\"\n   ",

            "desc": "About Mike Mushok\n          Mike Mushok is the baritone-wielding lead guitarist for the American band Staind, one of the most successful rock acts of the new millennium.\n      Since the band’s formation in 1995, Mike Mushok has been the lead guitarist, giving the band a unique, heavy sound by his use of baritone and 7-string baritone guitars.\n      The first two releases paved the way for the band by securing them opening spots for established bands such as Limp Bizkit and Sevendust. That was, of course, a huge break for them, but rarely has a band’s career skyrocketed as it did following the 2001 release of their third album Break The Cycle. It was a huge international success for the band and it spent 3 weeks at number 1 position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of The Billboard 200 in the UK and New Zealand. It has since its release sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n      Staind has been successful ever since, having most of their albums reaching number 1 positions on the billboards. This does, however, not mean that Staind will rest on their laurels in the future. “We’ve seen too many bands come and go to ever feel like we have a sense of security,” says guitarist Mike Mushok, reflecting back on his band’s studio efforts. “With each new album, we never want to rehash what we did before, but we also don’t want the new music to be so different that it alienates our fans. We try to walk that line. As a band and musicians you want to grow and mature, not just put out another ‘It’s Been Awhile’ eight years later. You want something new that hopefully builds on that, and you want something that enables you to continue to grow as songwriters.”\n      Mushok explains that Staind has been able to stand the test of time because they have focused their attention on music while too many of their peers were focusing on image, fashion and trends. “You look at any band that’s had any kind of longevity, and you have to have the music,” says Mushok. “Whether you’re playing a heavy song or not, there has to be a catchy riff there.”\n      In the past decade, Staind have sold more than 12 million records worldwide, had four No. 1 singles, six more singles in the Top 10 and their last three albums debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Album Chart. \n      In march 2013, Mushok was announced as the second guitarist of the band NEWST3D, fronted by former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted.\n      To create his timeless catchy riffs, Mushok uses the G-Force rack in both his live rig and in the studio. Here’s what he has to say about it…\n      I use the G-Force both live and in the studio - it’s so versatile and really sounds amazing. The unit can do whatever I need it to. I first discovered it in the studio and came up with sounds I was unable to come up with elsewhere, which led me to incorporating the unit in my live rig. I couldn't be happier with it!\n      He also uses the SCF, the MojoMojo overdrive and the Flashback delay on his live pedalboard. \n\n   ",

Over the years he has focused his time and energy as a respected session artist supporting the likes of Joe Perry and The Dixie Chicks. \n      Southern guitarist and songwriter, Audley Freed first gained recognition when he formed the band Cry Of Love in 1989, which was subsequently signed to Columbia Records. Their debut album ‘Brother’ impressed everyone and spawned two No. 1 and two Top Ten AOR hits, including ‘Peace Pipe’ that was named by Billboard as one of the ‘top 50 AOR songs of all time’. Following a second Columbia release in 1997, the band parted ways and Freed was free to join The Black Crowes on lead guitar.\nDuring his 3-year spell with The Black Crowes, Freed managed to tour the U.S., Europe and Asia, whilst also lending his talent to the recording of the album ‘Lions’. Freed proclaims that his “career highlight and life highlight” came when he at the turn of the millennium, together with the rest of the Crowes, shared the stage with Led Zeppelin guitarist and rock icon Jimmy Page. This collaboration was immortalized into rock & roll history through the recording of the double live album “Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes: Live at the Greek” that went on to reach Gold certification.\n      As an active and routined session player in Nashville, Freed truly managed to thrill audiences with his versatile range on the guitar. His projects as a guitarist and songwriter have included recordings with Gov′t Mule, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Job Cain, New Earth Mud, Joe Perry and The Dixie Chicks. Freed also joined the Dixie Chicks for their ‘Accidents and Accusations’ tour, then toured with Peter Frampton before joining Jakob Dylan′s band, the Gold Mountain Rebels, touring in support of Dylan′s solo album ‘Seeing Things’.\n      Freed's latest project has seen him reunite with Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and other notable musicians to form the group Trigger Hippy. Audley Freed is another musician who has been recommended TC Electronic gear by a friend and has been impressed by its flexibility. “When I plugged in the delay it sounded awesome! You can tweak it in a thousand ways” he says, as he talks about the Flashback Delay. TC had the pleasure of meeting Audley Freed and creating two unique TonePrints: the Slap Back for the Flashback Delay and the Leslie for the Shaker Vibrato.  \n   ",

The world’s first super group and power trio Cream also got hold of his attention, inspiring him to dig in to the groove and twelve-bar chord progressions of the blues.\n      As a live guitarist he has shared the stage with such diverse acts as famous Danish singers Anne Linnet and Anne Dorte Michelsen, renowned guitarist Billy Cross, singer-songwriter Tue West, Danish rock band The Storm fronted by singer Pernille Rosendahl and as of late rock outfit Mew.\n      In 2015 Mads teamed up with Mew, a full 18 years after he attended his first concert with the band: “I felt like a child being adopted into somebody else’s family. And at our first rehearsal, I really felt like it was my first day in a new school.” \n      Mads was brought in as a replacement for the guitarist and founding member of Mew. Filling in for another magnificent guitarist is never easy, but Mads has managed to claim his own chair, and carved his name solidly into the back of it. \n      He always brings all his own amps and effects, and on stage he tries to give the band a thicker sound – topped off with some weird modulation. Especially in the fingerpicking parts and intros, here the guitar stands alone, so Mads wants it to fill the whole canvas.\n      For the sweet, ear-filling art rock, he uses the classic slap delay. So immensely popular within the indie scene, that is almost serves as a trademark for the entire genre, yet aeons before the indie scene claimed it, however, it was a characteristic of rockabilly and related styles, think Bill Haley, Elvis Presley and anything Sam Phillips ever touched.\n      As a touring sidearm the slapback have been, is, always will be the first and biggest love on Mads’ pedal board.\n   ",

Parallels to David Bowie were thrown at the teen idol and in 1987 those parallels shared a stage when Sexton occasionally opened for Bowie on his Glass Spider Tour.\n      Before reaching the tender age of 20, Sexton’s great skills as a guitarist were in huge demand and he became a popular session player, recording with legendary artist such as Ronnie Wood and Keith Richard of the Rolling Stones, Don Henley founding member of the Eagles, and Bob Dylan. During this period he followed up his debut-album with the self-titled album Charles Sexton, recorded at the age of 20!\n      During the late 80s and 90s, Charlie Sexton was a very busy man. He released an album with his brother under the band name Will and the Kill, contributed songs to various movie soundtrack including True Romance, Air America, and Thelma & Louise, formed the blues/rock band Arc Angels in 1992, next he formed the Charlie Sexton Sextet in 1995, and in the mean time Sexton continued to perform with other artist and appearing on notable albums as Lucinda Williams’ Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Shawn Colvin’s Grammy-winning album A Few Small Repairs.\n      In 1999, Bob Dylan hired Sexton and he toured with Dylan until 2002 hailing praises of being one of Dylan’s best bands. They recorded a number of studio recordings, including Things Have Changed and the critically acclaimed album Love and Theft. Sexton then re-joined Dylan’s band in 2009-2012 and again in 2013 up until now. \n      Also in 2013 he joined Dave Matthews, Jakob Dylan and his own brother Will Sexton to form the band The Nauts and in 2014 Charlie Sexton played a role in the Golden Globe winning film Boyhood. Charlie Sexton has already had an amazing career and he will continue to amaze us in the future!\n   ",

While studying computer science at Columbia University, he took the time to soak in the rich jazz history the city has to offer and began honing his guitar skills, which would later see him team up with some of the best known names in jazz. After graduating from Columbia he has toured the world as a professional musician making his mark on the jazz scene in both New York and the rest of the world.\nHis career has led him to play with such musicians as pianist Bob James, bass legend Nathan East, drummer Harvey Mason, and many more during the last twenty years.\n      Jack Lee is without any doubt one of the world’s top jazz guitarists at the moment, and his skill is immediately apparent, but not ostentatious or in your face. His music rewards the attentive listener, who cares to listen for the wealth of details that can be found in his unique and intricate playing style that still manages to hold a gentle and lyrical flow, which instantly grabs the listeners by the heart.\n      On top of his work as the perfect sideman for the greats, Jack Lee also has his own world music ensemble, Asianergy. This eclectic ensemble departs somewhat from his jazzy roots by blending his love for jazz with more regional sounds from all over Asia and South America.\nHe has drawn upon the many connections he has made, while playing all over the world, to find some of the best and most interesting musicians from around the globe, to play with Asianergy.\n      Jack Lee has released 12 albums, among them are Asianergy 1 and 2.\n      Jack Lee incorporates several different products from TC Electronic, to achieve his sound. And because the pedals are transparent, he can incorporate all of them or none of them on a case by case basis, as he sees fit.\n   ",

But Brad Whitford is probably best known as the one of two guitarists for legendary classic rockers Aerosmith.\n      Replacing the original guitarist Ray Tabano, Brad Whitford joined Aerosmith in 1971 and Aerosmith went on to become one of the most successful bands of that time. Though, Whitford decided to leave the band in 1981 in favour of his own project Whitford/St. Holmes, which included singer Derek St. Holmes. However, they released only a single self-titled album before the project dissolved in 1981. Brad Whitford also briefly toured with former band-mate Joe Perry on The Joe Perry Project before once again joining up with the rest of the gang in Aerosmith in 1984.\n      While touring and performing with Aerosmith, Brad Whitford likes to keep it simple when it comes to effects and pedals. But, he does prefer the wide range of possibilities that TC effect pedals actually provide him. For example, he relies heavily on the Flashback Delay pedal that offers him such a wide variety of great echoes – and he especially digs the 2290 echo modulation. Also the TC Vortex Flanger holds a very special place on his board – a pedal that provides a nice thick flanger effect yet covers so much different grounds.\n      No doubt the products from TC hold a very special place in Brad’s heart. As Brad’s personal guitar tech Marco Moir puts it: “So much TC gear is here because you can’t do without!”.\n\n   ",

His skilled mastering of the piano led to a recording gig with Miles Davis for his 1985 “Tutu” album. Holzman stayed with Davis for four years, eventually becoming his musical director. In the early 1990s, he founded the band Mona Lisa Overdrive, which subsequently changed its name to Brave New World due to copyright issues. In his carrier as a recording and touring musician Holzman has worked with Robben Ford, Marcus Miller and Ray Wilson, just to mention a few. In the last couple of years Adam Holzman has toured with prog rock sensation Steven Wilson.\n      That’s all fine and well, but what is a keyboard player doing on TC Electronic’s page, you ask?\n      Well, whenever something really great and versatile is made, there’s virtually no limit for its uses. The Fender Bassman amp was (as the name suggests) a Bass amp only, but guitarists found that it cranked up even nicer when fed with an electric guitar. Similarly, Leslie-cabinets were originally the Hammond-player choice only, but Hendrix, Clapton and other guitar geniuses changed that throughout the 1960s. In the same way, keyboard players have also taken guitar-centric technology and made it theirs. Ever since the release of TC Electronic’s legendary Stereo Chorus Flanger, Rhodes-players have used the pedal to give an edge to their playing.\nAdam Holzman has an extensive collection of guitar pedals. Among the crowd you will find the Hall Of Fame and the Flashback Delay.\n   ",

            "desc": "About John 5\n          John 5 is a guitarist that defies regular norms by mastering styles ranging from bluegrass to shred metal. Besides playing for Rob Zombie, he’s collaborated with David Lee Roth and Marilyn Manson and has released several well-received instrumental albums.\n      Most renowned guitarists are known through their effects and tones but not many are recognizable for their pure individual material. Add to this John 5’s ability to play in any situation, flowing effortlessly from bluegrass to industrial and metal and you’ve got one of the most versatile contemporary guitarists.\n      John 5, also known as John Lowery, started playing guitar after watching the “Hee Haw” show as a young child. He quickly became immersed in country and bluegrass while at the same time discovering the music of Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, Kiss and The Monkeys. With support from his parents, John 5 played different gigs before moving to L.A. at age 17 to become a session guitarist. \n      It was there that he met Whitesnake’s Rudy Sarzo and befriended producer Bob Marlette who both introduced him to other musicians. From 1989 onwards, John 5 worked as a studio musician doing TV show soundtracks, movie soundtracks, commercials and infomercials. This lead to John 5 playing for Lita Ford and opening for long inspirational band, Kiss. In 1996, having missed the audition deadline for Marilyn Manson, John 5 teamed up with ex-Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford to form industrial metal band 2wo, which he played in for two years before finally joining MM as a replacement for Zim Zum. \n      Taking the moniker John 5, he embarked for the Mechanical Animals tour and also wrote on the next album, “Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)”. In 2004, John 5 and MM parted ways and in 2005, while John 5 was working on radio rock band Loser he also began work with cult rock artist, Rob Zombie. John worked on the “Educated Horses” album, co-writing eight out of eleven tracks with Zombie and also did scores for his films “Tyrannosaurus Rex” and “The Lords of Salem”.\n      Regarding his part in Rob Zombie, John 5 has been known to admit that it is the best band he has ever been in with since he has a lot of freedom with songwriting and the experience is a lot of fun; “It’s the best band I’ve ever been in by far in my whole life. It’s so much fun, I can’t even begin to explain”, John 5 says.\n      Teaming up with an impressive array of artists throughout his career, John 5 has never limited himself to one style. He strongly believes in constantly broadening his musical horizons and acknowledges that different music styles all have something to offer. This particular view on music imprints/ lays… on the way he develops his solo music, being quite evident in his albums. He has released six successful instrumental albums so far and all are neat hybrids of country, progressive bluegrass, metal and hard rock – a genre he likes to call “blackgrass”. Among talented artists guesting on his records are Albert Lee, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Jim Root contributing to the already explosive energy that John 5’s dazzling technique exudes. \n      As a master of styles ranging from country to shred metal, John 5’s gear must live up to the extreme demands of his performance. Consequently, he has opted to use TC’s Flashback Delay and MojoMojo pedals to configure his fenomenal guitar sound which is always nothing short of an intense and enjoyable ride.\n   ",

Here he tells us about the TC Electronic effects that he uses on the road and in the studio.\n      Indeed you could say that with the number of bands that Stef Burns has played in and also the wealth of top artists he has recorded with, it is a good job he started his career at an early age – in fact Stef started playing guitar at the age of six and was in his first band by 9! After playing in various acts doing covers he moved into the Jazz/Rock fusion arena before playing Funk in the band Omega at the start of the 80s. After a stint with Pablo Cruise he joined Sheila E’s band and played on two of her albums: Romance 1600 and Sheila E. He was greatly influenced by Prince’s funk playing and got to see it close up while playing with Sheila E and opening for Prince for his Purple Rain Tour. \n      Stef then toured around the world with Berlin (who had a massive hit at the time with Take My Breath Away), and Michael Bolton. He also played in the bands The VU and Y&T with whom he recorded four albums. The nineties saw Stef playing with Alice Cooper for four years and appearing on the Monsters Of Rock tour with Ozzy Osborne, Megadeth and Faith No More. Stef now regularly tours with Huey Lewis and the News and Vasco Rossi, an Italian artist who has released more than 30 albums and has become a huge star in Europe. \n      With more than 30 years playing with the biggest names around Stef clearly knows his guitar gear, so it’s no surprise to learn that he uses a lot of TC Electronic gear…\n      “I love my G-Major 2,” he says. “It has all the rack effects I need – like, delay, reverb and stereo modulation – in one unit. It is also very easy to use, which is important for me because I don't like to spend a lot of time messing with gear when I can be playing, writing and recording. The sounds are wonderful and so clean and pure, something that TC always does so consistently. I like to use the harmonizer as well – I can get anything I want in any key for smart harmonies. And with my expression pedal I get great Whammy and Wha, so two less things to carry around.”\n      “I also use the TC Electronic Octa Screamer and I love it,” Stef continues. “I kick it in for some solos with my band [Stef Burns Group] and with Vasco and my tone soars up into a screaming high harmonic sound. Just killer! You can use it as a great fuzz with the Octa mix turned down or vice versa using your own distortion and just the high octave effect.”\n      Finally Stef tells us about his TC Electronic Vintage Tube Primer: “I love it. It has a natural overdrive without too much color. It is perfect for any live situation as well as in the studio!\"\n   ",

At the age of 9, Jordan entered the Juillard School of Music where he began studying classical piano, but after being introduced to progressive rock, through acts such as Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson and Genesis, and the vast sonic potential of modern synthesizers in his late teens there was no turning back, and Jordan immediately ditched the classical piano for keyboards, synths and the amazing world of prog.rock.\n      After being voted “Best New Talent” by Keyboard Magazine in 1994, the world of prog.rock started to notice Jordan, and after a quick stint with the legendary Dixie Dregs and progressive super group Liquid Tension Experiment, Jordan joined Dream Theater in 1999, and hasn’t looked back since!

His overdriven and highly reverberated guitar-sound is a key element in the group’s musical expression.\n\n      If ever there was a script for making it in the music industry, Mark Sheehan and his band colleagues Danny O'Donoghue and Glen Power, seems to have stumbled upon it. Based on sheer speculation, that script would tell the story of two childhood friends growing up in Ireland dreaming of one day being discovered by a major music label, touring all over the world and opening shows for Paul McCartney or U2.\n      Of course all of this is speculation – We’ll never know if such a script exists. We can only take notion of the fact that the two friends dream came true.\n      Sheehan and O'Donoghue – who have been friends since the age of 12 – became a songwriting and production partnership in the mid-90s, and worked for a while in Los Angeles as songwriters and producers, but later moved back to Dublin, where they recruited Glen Power for their new band “The Script”.\nThe Script's eponymous debut album was released in 2008 where it went straight to the number one spot on the UK's album charts, mainly due to the success of the two singles \"We Cry\" and \"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\", the latter reaching number 2 in Ireland, Denmark, and the UK. 2009 became a busy year for the band, touring all over the world and being the supporting act for Paul McCartney´s three concerts at the New York Citi Field, before releasing their second album “Science & Faith” in September 2010.\n      The Scripts´ latest album from 2012 simply bares the title “#3”, and contains their biggest single hit to date; \"Hall of Fame\" (here at TC that title really reverberates *wink, wink*). The single has been certified 5x Platinum in Australia, Platinum in Italy, 2x Platinum in New Zealand, 6x Platinum in Norway, 2x Platinum in Sweden and 2x Platinum in the US. The song also peaked at number 1 in the UK, Scotland, Ireland, Europe and Austria, and charted in over 30 countries.\n      The group is not intimidated by their own popularity though. They are still writing and recording everything themselves – as they always have.\n   ",

During this time he watched a Foo Fighters Live Special on MTV and Dave Grohl’s charisma and enthusiasm as a performer convinced Mark to start playing the guitar – and boy are we thrilled about that decision!  \n      Dave Grohl being his gateway into music, metal-guitar-legends like James Hetfield of Metallica, Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, and the late Randy Rhoads were the “hard drugs” of his musical inspiration. Especially Metallica was such an inspiration that Mark started out learning the entirety of Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning on guitar. From that point Mark got into death metal, black metal, and other types of extreme stuff.\n      In the early 2000’s Mark moved to Washington DC and started to hang out with the Periphery guys – in particular fellow guitarist Misha Mansoor. They started the studio project Haunted Shores, where they released songs online for a couple of years, and one time in 2011 during Periphery’s tour in Australia Mark was asked to fill-in on guitar. Knowing Periphery so well, this super-sub quickly became a permanent member in the Periphery starting line-up!\n      Since Mark joined Periphery they have released 3 studio albums and toured the world multiple times. Mark and Misha are currently finishing up a new Haunted Shores album, which is going to be, according to Mark, way more negative than older HS and worlds faster and darker than Periphery – an album to look forward to! \n\n   ",

            "desc": "About Ryan Roxie\n          Guitarist and singer-songwriter Ryan Roxie, born in California, currently resides in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the founding member of Roxie 77 and probably best known for his guitar work with Slash’s Snakepit and legendary harbinger of rock and roll, Alice Cooper.\n      Ryan grew up in a small town called Pleasanton in the East Bay. With a father who played the trumpet, and a high school marching-band drum-bashing mother, Ryan was destined to venture down the psychedelic and artistic pathway of music. However, owing to a greater interest in beating down a drum kit, it wasn’t until years later, at the age of eleven, that he really started getting into the rocking note shredding realm of the electric guitar. This autodidact musician learned the style of the guitar from listening to his father’s dusty old recorder, forging his very own unique way of the instrument.\n      Besides Keith Partridge, who influenced Roxie at a quite early age, his influences cover world-known axe-wielding musicians such as Brian May, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Stevens and Rick Nielsen, to mention a few. Prior to the Alice Cooper ERA (starting in 1996), Ryan worked with Candy, Electric Angels, Dad’s Porn Mag. He did extensive work as ‘hired gun-man’ with various artists including Gilby Clarke, Tal Bachman, Bob Rock, James Michael and also wrote and recorded with Slash’s Snakepit. Ryan Roxie’s own band ‘Roxie 77’ was formed in 2002 and has recorded two albums, ‘Peace, Love and Armageddon’ released in 2004 and ‘Two Sides To Every Story’, which was only released as a download through the band’s website during 2009.\n      When Ryan goes on stage he fancies bringing a true arsenal of our sparkling tone-twisting TC effect pedals. So, we seized this opportunity to sit down with Ryan in his own personal rehearsal studio in Stockholm. After hours of tweaking and twisting, we ended up with a set of cool and perfectly crafted TonePrints – a longer color- and atmosphere adding kind of echo sound for the Flashback Delay and a subtle, but thick, Leslie-effect type of sound for the Shaker Vibrato, mimicking the exact style of the string-bending phenomenon that is Ryan Roxie.\n   ",

The chemistry turned out to be undeniable, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n      That was in 2002, and Demmel has been an integral part of Machine Head ever since. He draws his influences from a wide range of bands across many genres of metal and beyond. Thrash metal and groove metal may be the most obvious, but many of the greats from the 70’s and 80’s have influenced the sound as well. Demmel cites Angus Young of AC/DC as one of his earliest influences, and one of the primary reasons for picking up his first guitar.\n \nWhile Machine Head played for many years without Demmel, he turned out to be a perfect fit with the aggressive and melodic music of the band.\n \nFrom Dublin, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Demmel grew up. In the 80’ies when the Thrash movement was blossoming in the area, and bands like Metallica were blazing a trail, for young dreamers with long hair and pointy guitars.\n“They paved the way and gave us all hope that it was possible,” Demmel has said of Metallica’s influence.\n \nDrawn to the aggressiveness and energetic nature of the style, he joined thrash band Vio-Lence right out of high school. They put out a few records and toured enough to assure the young Demmel, that he would spend his life as a musician.\nRobb Flynn, left Vio-Lence to start Machine Head in 1991, which very quickly became one of Demmel’s favorite bands, though it would be more than ten years before chance brought them together again, when Demmel joined Machine Head.\n \nBy that point Demmel’s own music career had slowed down somewhat, and going on tour with Machine Head was supposed to be a one time thing. A sort of last hurrah.\n“It would bring closure to my music career. But the chemistry was just magic.”\n      Demmel has released four albums with Machine Head since joining in 2002, filling the time between releases with an almost inhuman tour schedule.\nOn their latest album, Bloodstone and Diamonds the TC Electronic Flashback Delay was instrumental in achieving the aggressive sound and the screaming lead lines, that bring metal heads across the world to Machine Head’s shows.\n      Artist photo by Jason Korolenko\n   ",

In the 90s, Ritenour was a founding member of Fourplay, the most successful band in contemporary jazz, with keyboardist Bob James, bassist Nathan East and drummer Harvey Mason. The first Fourplay album in 1991 spent an unprecedented 33 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s contemporary jazz chart. Adding to this legacy is his latest CD Smoke ‘n’ Mirrors; the recently completed Grammy nominated recording Amparo, (a follow-up with Dave Grusin to their highly-successful 2001 Grammy Award nominated contemporary classical crossover CD) and producer of Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band’s latest CD Act Your Age (which is nominated for 3 Grammys.\n      It’s been a long road since the seventies, when Ritenour’s legendary Tuesday night appearances at the famed Baked Potato, with a band including Dave Grusin, Patrice Rushen, Harvey Mason and Ernie Watts became part of the musical landscape for five years.

In fact, losing the tips of his fingers on his fretting hand is what shaped his unique sound, resorting to light string gauges and down tuning. \n      Tony’s interest in music began when he was just a teenager. Hank Marvin & the Shadows influenced a young left-handed boy to play guitar, which through the years unfolded into an international career. It all started with a band called Earth that Tony assembled with his school buddies Terry “Geezer“ Butler, Bill Ward and John “Ozzy“ Osbourne. The band changed their name to Black Sabbath, and soon became a blueprint for hundreds of others that followed. \n      Black Sabbath shook up the heavy metal scene with dark lyrical subjects, distinctive riff based music and dark and haunting sounds.  That led into successful all time classic releases such as “Black Sabbath“, “Paranoid“, “Master of Reality“, “Vol. 4., & “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath“, putting them on the map as the worlds top hard rock band.  \n      The band hit a rough patch in the late 1970’s that consequently led to Ozzy leaving but they bounced back with singer Ronnie James Dio recording more classics – “Heaven & Hell” and “Mob Rules”. The original lineup subsequently reunited for a number of tours and earned a Grammy award for the track “Iron Man“ from their “Reunion” album.  \n      Tony kept a solo career going with two stand-out albums – “Iommi” and “Fused”, plus the highly regarded “The Devil You Know” with Dio and Butler under the band moniker Heaven & Hell.  In 2011 the original Black Sabbath line-up began work on a new album, “13” which was released in June 2013.  No sooner had they started than Tony was diagnosed with lymphoma but despite receiving treatment he continued to record and the result gave the band their first US number 1 as well as number 1’s in the UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden, etc.\n      In 2013 the band will tour the world going to Asia, North America, South America and Europe.   \n   ",

            "desc": "About Johnny Hiland\n          Johnny Hiland was practically born with a guitar in his hand and with bluegrass music in his blood. At the tender age of ten, he won a talent show that put him in front of an audience in New York City. At that time he’d already been touring with the family band for several years.\n      A bluegrass picking marvel, Hiland is born legally blind, so there were a lot of the things his friends could do, that he never really could. This led him to the guitar when he was just two years old. Since his childhood Hiland has branched out from bluegrass, owing to the influence of rock guitarists like Eddie Van Halen and Joe Satriani, who he was exposed to in high school.\nIn 1996 he moved to Nashville, and he quickly became a well-known face at several local clubs, which later earned him a residency at the famous Turf club, and as if that wasn’t enough he was also the first unsigned artist in Nashville to get an endorsement deal with Fender. \n      It was while living and playing in Nashville that Steve Vai heard Hiland's playing, and offered to sign him to his Favored Nations label. His self-titled debut album came out in 2004. By that time he was also a busy session musician in Nashville. He has recorded with Ricky Skaggs, Lynn Anderson, Toby Keith and many others. \n      In 2011 he signed with Shrapnel Records putting out the record “All Fired Up” where he once again shows off his hybrid picking that exhibits both his other-worldly speed and uncanny precision. On “All Fired Up” he once again demonstrate his chops with a mix of chicken picking, heavy rock, country and pop.\n      Johnny Hiland loves to teach, and he continues to give private guitar lessons. He has also made several instructional videos, teaching different guitar skills, mainly chicken picking, which is something of a specialty of his. \n      Throughout the years Johnny has toured with his own band, The Johnny Hiland Band, as well as playing with artists like Sammy Hagar Ted Nugent, George Clinton, Joe Bonamassa, Steve Vai, and many more.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Joe Perry\n          Joe Perry’s name is synonymous with the raw six-string energy that gives rock phenomenon Aerosmith their trademark edge. The power and craftsmanship of his guitar playing has transfixed fans for over 30 years and placed him in rock’n’roll history.\n      Like so many guitar virtuosos, Joe Perry first became interested in playing at a very young age. Classic tracks like “Rock Around the Clock” and “Tutti Frutti” marked his childhood, and later legends like The Rolling Stones and The Beatles made their entrance. He picked up the guitar in his teens and started jamming to blues-rockers The Yardbirds and John Mayall. These influences worked their way into his style, leading to the tough and rough blues licks and riffs that would later make Aerosmith famous. \n      Some of Perry’s earlier band efforts were with groups like Flash, Just Us and Plastic Glass before getting together with Tom Hamilton to form The Jam Band. Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer soon joined them and they changed the moniker to ‘Aerosmith’, just because nobody had a problem with the name. The band stole the ‘70s music scene with thrusts of metal, glam and cool urban charisma. They combined the blues grit of the Stones and The Yardbirds with the heavy riffing of Led Zeppelin and in no time their tours were sold-out, albums like “Get Your Wings”, “Toys in the Attic” and “Rocks” went gold and platinum and they were off to become one of the world’s biggest rock bands.\n      The ‘80s were tougher times for Aerosmith and both Perry and Whitford left the band to pursue solo projects. Perry’s band, The Joe Perry Project, issued an inspired and well-received debut called “Let the Music Do the Talking” followed by “I’ve Got the Rock’n’Rolls Again” in 1981 and “Once a rocker, always a rocker” in 1983. \n      1984 saw Aerosmith reunite and the band went on to collaborate with big-name songwriters and producers to launch their long-awaited comeback. What followed was a fruitful collaboration with rappers Run DMC for a remake of Aerosmith’s 1975 hit “Walk This Way” and a string of successful albums including “Pump” and “Get a Grip”. In 1998, Perry helped create the group’s first number one hit single, “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”, which was featured on the soundtrack to the box-office success film Armageddon. Aerosmith kept the pace up throughout the 90s and 2000s with their bone-shaking rock riffs releasing acclaimed albums like “Just Push Play” and “Honkin on Bobo”.\n      Perry also focused on separate projects during the 2000s including his first solo album, “Joe Perry”, a collection of smoldering tunes in which every instrument but the drums is played by Perry himself. The record received universal praise and earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Song (“Mercy”). In 2006, the Joe Perry Project (sporting a new line-up) released “Have Guitar Will Travel”, an album that shows Perry’s own musical tastes and is an exciting mix of influences, from the Doors, modern pop rock, Aerosmith to Fleetwood Mac, proving Perry’s ferocious guitar skills. \n      Other solo credits include instrumental music for indie movie “This Thing of Ours”, composing the theme song for the “Spiderman” TV series, lending his guitar skills to Mick Jagger’s “Godess in the Doorway” and playing “Les Paul & Friends”. \n      Ultimately, Joe Perry is one of the maverick guitar greats of all time, one of the rock legends who continuously inspire teens to pick up the guitar. His fiery signature sound is unique and TC is happy to be able to contribute to it. Perry has chosen to use our Hall of Fame Reverb and FlashBack Delay pedals, along with our PolyTune and Studio Bundle Complete professional plug-ins to shape his sound. \n   ",

            "desc": "About Richard Kruspe\n          Richard Z. Kruspe is the lead guitarist of the German industrial metal band Rammstein. Since the early 90s, Rammstein has been a leading pioneer and a highly influential force within the metal genre, continuously pushing the boundaries and challenging the status quo whenever they can. \n      As a child living in East Germany, Richard spent a lot of time in his room because he was grounded all the time. Richard explains: “Music helped me escape and ’go somewhere else’. Living in a country, where you couldn’t go anywhere music gave me the freedom to ’travel’ in different countries.“ At the time Richard listened to a lot of 70s stuff: AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and, later on punk and metal. After the Berlin Wall came down Richard became aware of the Californian funk-metal wave listening to bands like Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Heads Up. Eventually he started getting more into industrial bands like Big Black, Ministry and Swans. Richard's first band was called Das Elegante Chaos (The Elegant Chaos), a punk band from a small town in the north of Germany. However, his desire to create his own music led him to form a funk metal band called Orgasm Death Gimmick. But Richard was never completely happy with being ‘half’ into a ‘California funk-metal vibe’, and started thinking about doing something more ’German’. Consequently a band was put together for a one-off show. As he was playing the songs, he realized where he wanted to go musically: to explore a combination of machines, rhythm and the roots of German and Western music in rock. There was nothing serious about it in the beginning - Richard and his band mates were just trying to combine things in a different way. Nobody at this point thought that it was going to be something as big as Rammstein.\n      Richard was a fan of show bands like Kiss, and show became a part of the concept from the very birth of Rammstein. “Everyone in the band was interested in more than just the music. So we started out with small show gimmicks always trying to keep the balance between the music and the show. But sometimes we’d go a little bit overboard and create more show than music”, Richard admits.\n      Although Rammstein’s lyrics are in German the still play all over the world for lot of people that do not understand German: “You have to see it more like an opera. If you go to an opera language doesn’t matter anymore. We try to create theatre, a visual show that people can see without having to rely on only lyrics”. Richard Kruspe is a perfectionist when it comes to guitar sounds: “I’ve tried every preamp on the planet, every microphone and I have built my own studios. It’s all about the room anyway - that’s the secret if you want to create music.” In his studio Richard is usually a lo-fi guy recording with real amps, cabinets and microphones. He has even invented a robot that changes the microphone position, to avoid running back and forth from the control booth to the recording room. When it comes to effects Kruspe is very open-minded: “There’s not one effect that I use in my sound. I’m trying many different things to feel inspired and I’m always really flexible and go into a lot of different effects to see what comes out. But when you get too much into the studio world and you spend a year trying out all those amps, preamps and microphones you forget writing songs. So I try to keep a balance about it and these days I concentrate more on writing than on sound”.\n      As a result of Rammstein's elaborate live shows, Kruspe has opted for much of his effects rig to be handled sidestage by his guitar tech, Lutz Buch. Buch explains that the TC Nova Delay is used quite a lot as well as the Nova Dynamics, which is used for adding more compression and volume. The Nova Modulator, D-Two and PolyTune are also essential TC equipment that travel the world with Kruspe whilst he is on tour.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Troy Van Leeuwen\n          Troy Dean Van Leeuwen began playing music at a young age and started playing guitar at age 13. He soon became a sought after session player, which later led him to join such legendary rock bands as A Perfect Circle and Queens of the Stone Age.\n      US musician and producer Troy Van Leeuwen first picked up a guitar nearly 30 years ago and soon honed his craft in many bands including Failure and 60 Cycle. But is was his skill as a session musician that led to a very high profile outing with supergroup A Perfect Circle with Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howderel. Troy played on their huge debut album Mer De Norms which got to number four in the Billboard 200. He also played on three tracks on the band’s second album Thirteenth Step but a successful audition then led to him joining Queens Of The Stone Age. He famously had to learn 30 songs in a week before heading out on a major tour with them in 2002 after the release of their third album Songs For The Deaf. \n      Troy’s been with Queens Of The Stone Age ever since, playing on their Gold-selling album Lullabies To Paradise and 2007’s Era Vulgaris. The band have built up a big following thanks to their sell-out performances around the world that have also included some huge festival appearances. Troy also plays in Sweethead, whose self-titled debut album came out last year. He uses a range of gear from TC Electronic, TC-Helicon and Dynaudio. In fact why don’t we let him fill us in…?\n      “The set up I use depends of what project I’m working on,” he reveals. “With Sweethead I am the only guitar player so sonically I have to cover a lot of ground. That means lots of processing, MIDI capabilities and stereo imaging for both guitar and vocals. For Queens Of The Stone Age the use of ambience and the color of sound is what I focus on. So the set up I use is always evolving. And TC Electronic always seems to be a part of this ever changing experiment that is my sound.”\n      “I’ve been using TC Electronic gear for years,” he continues. “My first TC pedal was a Boost/Line Drive Distortion pedal. In studios I would always use the 2290 for delays and doubling and in my home studio I use two TC PowerCores in my Mac and a FireworX for processing. On the road my main effects processor for guitar is the G-Force, the Nova Reverb pedal and a TC-Helicon VoiceLive2.”\n      That sure is a lot, so what is it that led him to choose so much TC gear? \n      “TC Electronic is a company that’s been around for decades and the quality has always been consistent,” he replies. “Most of the time I use gear not just for the sound but for the durability out on the road. And on the road, things usually break. Every piece of TC gear I own has lasted throughout my years as a touring musician.”\n      And it’s a good job that he finds it so durable because Troy has some interesting ideas when it comes to actually using the gear…\n      “My philosophy with gear is to abuse it, push it, make it scream and occasionally spill wine on it,” he says. “So I’ll use the PowerCore Tubifex plug-in for drums. The sound of the G-Force is really designed for guitar or bass because the effects can sound like pedals if you want them to but I also use it on vocals. And the VoiceLive 2 can compete with any studio multi-effects processor in the studio as well as live and I even use it on keys. As long as the meters are pinned in the red it’s doing what I want.”\n      And as Troy is using the gear he finds that TC have made it very easy to use and abuse it…\n      “It’s easy to dive into the features of all of the units I use,” he says, “and yet there are depths to be explored if I choose. The G-Force, for instance, has endless routing combinations just in case you want to put an auto-wha filter after a reverb in series or parallel and then distort the left side of the mix.”\n      Finally what does Troy have planned for the future?\n      “Near future plans are for Sweethead to be touring and promoting our debut record in North America, Europe and the UK starting this spring and throughout the summer. There are some loose plans for Queens Of The Stone Age to do some shows in the fall and start recording a new record shortly after. But there’s always a plan to create music.”\n   ",

            "desc": "About Orianthi\n          Orianthi is an Australian guitarist, perhaps best known as the guitarist of the late Michael Jackson, but her solo career is taking off big time as well. She picked up the guitar when she was eleven and has played with the likes of Steve Vai and Carlos Santana.\n      Australian guitar wonder Orianthi Panagaris actually started out playing the piano at age 3, but she picked up an acoustic guitar at age 6. “My father is a guitarist, so that’s why I started playing,” Orianthi says as she continues, “I listened to a lot of Elvis, Roy Orbison and The Beatles when I was really young, and then I studied classical when I was 10. I moved on to electric when I was 11 after attending a Santana concert. I turned to my dad and begged him for an electric guitar, and when I got one, I never put it down. I have been playing guitar for 18 years, and I still have the same passion for it.” \n      In 2009, she released her debut album entitled ‘Believe’, and, over the years, she has been collaborating with legends such as Prince, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana – and of course ‘The King of Pop’, Michael Jackson.\n      This Is It\nOrianthi became part of the ‘This Is It’ band, but as we all know, MJ passed away before the shows even began, and it was as big a shock for her as it was to the rest of the world, and her spontaneous reaction was simply to start crying as it was for millions of fans everywhere. However, she is also extremely grateful to have been part of his band, and as she puts it: “He made me believe in myself even more by making me part of the band – it was just a dream come true.”\n      The Gear\nPlaying music at the highest level, Orianthi needs her gear to be at a similar level, which means that plenty of TC Electronic gear has found its way into her rig. “Well, at this moment, I use G-Major 2 for some of my clean sounds such as combinations of Reverb and Delay. Also, the intro to my show is really dramatic, and it has a guitar part that needs a harmonizer effect. The effect from G-Major 2 sounds amazing and makes the part stand out more,” Orianthi tells us. “Further, my guitar tech, Danny \"Borga\" O’Neil, has added a G-Force to my sound arsenal, and as we go along we keep discovering more and more stunning sounds, and finally, for my B-rig (fly rig), I use a Nova Delay as well as a G-System and a PolyTune.”\n      “The gear is incorporated into my rack, which is off stage, and my guitar tech runs everything, punching in my sounds when they are needed,” Orianthi explains. “The features and programmability of my TC Electronic gear are really amazing, and the cleanness really enhances my tone. My guitar tech listens to the sounds and simply programs what sounds right and it is off and running. The sounds are so clean and distinctive it just enhances my tone for certain parts.”\n      Composing, recording and mixing\nWe also asked Orianthi about her approach to composing, recording and mixing. “Well, my approach to songwriting is to just let the melodies and lyrics come to you and not to ‘overthink’. The best tunes have been the ones that didn’t take too long to write,” Orianthi elaborates. “When it comes to recording, I really like to keep one of the first few takes as they tend to have the best vibe and energy. The best mixes to me are the ones that have a lot of clarity to them. Not a wall of sound, and all of the guitar parts are panned, so the vocals aren't buried in the mix.”\n      What's next...?\nFinally, we wanted to know what Orianthi has planned for the near future. “Lots of touring,” Orianthi replies, “and my next album which I am already writing out here on the road.”\n   ",

He envisioned a future where she would be one of the biggest modern classical piano players, gracing the world with her music, but young Jen had other plans. She wanted to rock ‘n’ roll!\n      After hearing the infectious riffs and melodies of rock ‘n’ roll legends, KISS there was no shadow of a doubt in Jen’s mind about what she wanted to do with her life. She wanted to play the guitar, and she wanted to rock it like no-one else. So at the tender age of 7, Jen was already rippin’ her first power chords, and with the help of her favorite Ritchie Kotzen VHS tape, she quickly started to delve into the fast-paced world of shredding. At age 12 she had her first band up and running, and by her early teens she was playing in one of the most popular AC/DC tribute bands in her home country. On top of that she’s played in the comical metal band, Knorkator and wielded a hard-hitting bass for German Black Metal outfit Equilibrium.\n      As you can probably tell, Jen isn’t known for standing still. She is constantly evolving and moving forward, and it is this hyper-ambitious drive and her undeniable musical talent that saw her land the gig as the new guitarist for American goth-metal megastars, Evanescence in August 2015.\n      The Evanescence gig has already seen Jen’s skills multiply tenfold at both ends of the musical spectrum. Baritone and extended-range guitars have made her tone heavier than ever, while getting more into spacious effects like chorus, reverb and delay for the quieter ambient parts of Evanscence music has taken her sound and melodic feel to new thrilling heights. \n\n   ",

            "desc": "About Peredur Ap Gwynedd\n          Peredur ap Gwynedd is a Welsh guitarist, born and raised in South Wales. Ap Gwynedd is mostly known as a member of the Australian rock/electronica band, Pendullum, but he has also performed with acts such as Natalie Imbruglia, Norman Cook, Sophie Ellis Bextor and Mylene Farmer.\n      Pendulum's guitarist, Peredur ap Gwynedd, explains why TC Electronic's G-System never leaves his side. \"It is quite simply the best effects unit!\"\n      Take one look at the high-octane Drum 'n' Bass phenomenon that is Pendulum and you soon realize that this band challenges every rule in the music production handbook.\nThe music that they make defies categorisation, veering as it does from dark Drum 'n' Bass to catchy 'Rock-out' Pop but it is certainly a successful mix. When they played in front of tens of thousands at BBC Radio 1's 'One Big Weekend', headlining with Madonna, surely even they must have pinched themselves and wondered quite how they'd done it. Some of this success can undoubtedly be attributed to the fact they present their Dance sound with heaps of Rock attitude, so a Pendulum gig mixes conventional guitars with DJs, MCs with synths and mighty drums with samples for an unbelievable and unforgettable live experience.\n      Peredur ap Gwynedd joined Pendulum as guitarist, having previously played for some very high profile acts - including a nine-year stint with Aussie songstress Natalie Imbruglia. \n      \"I've played with all sorts,\" he says. \"I started working with Pendulum in 2004 and played on the first album. And then a couple of years ago they asked me to join full time. Then we got signed to Warners… and the rest is history!\"\n      While the band avoid the traditional software-only route to dance music, they are not afraid to embrace the best of other technology and Peredur has just that with his G-System, TC Electronic's unique and powerful floor-standing effects package that also offers integration and control over your existing guitar effects.\n      \"I've used all sorts of effects in the past,\" says Peredur, \"but a couple of my friends had G-Systems and said that it was the dog's bollocks. I saw the specs and thought, 'yeah that's exactly what I need'. It seemed to do everything and was very sturdy.\"\n      His initial conclusions have been proven correct, as the G-System has been at his feet for the band's recent major world tours, proving to be an indispensable addition to Peredur's sound. \n      \"It sounds great and is quite simply the best effects unit,\" he says. \"The versatility is another boon - the fact that you can put your favorite effects and amp sounds into G-System's effects loops and let G-System change the parameters on them is quite an amazing thing.\"\n      Peredur then goes on to detail how easily he blends his older pedals and effects into the world of G-System…\n      \"It's fantastic,\" he begins. \"I use it with a Hughes & Kettner TriAmp Mark II. The TriAmp has six different preamp channels and I utilize all six of these with the G-System's effects loops. I also use a Mesa Boogie V-Twin in one of the loops, a Hughes & Kettner Rotosphere - the Leslie Simulator - and a Keeley Modded Tube Screamer.\"\n      Peredur clearly knows a good sound, but G-System not only allows him to integrate and control his favorite effects, it also allows him to quickly and easily switch the order of them in the effects chain - something that would previously have taken an age to do.\n      \"It's very straightforward to edit G-System and use the software that comes with it as an effects management system,\" explains Peredur. \"With most effects units it takes a long time and some patience to change the effects order, but with the software that comes bundled with G-System it's made my life so much easier.\"\n      \"I can chop and change effects within the system at the drop of a hat. Recently we had a massive overhaul in the set list, brought in new songs, changed the order quite dramatically… and it took less than three minutes to change the order of the songs in the G-System.\"\n      But Peredur is not only using G-System as a controller - he's also impressed with the unit's onboard effects. \"It's an amazing sounding piece of equipment,\" he says. \"The delays are fantastic and the modulation is top notch. I use a smattering of delays to beef up the sound whenever I'm doing a solo or playing a lead line. And at the end of our set I use a patch with infinite repeats, so I'm using it as a sample/hold. It repeats the last phrase I play as we walk off.\"\n      Overall, though, it's the fact that G-System has survived life on the road that impresses Peredur the most as he concludes: \"One of its best features is how it's built. I've done over 170 gigs with it and it's had its fair share of knocks, drinks have been spilled on it, and a flight case even fell on it, but it still works perfectly!\"\n      Pendulum's third album, Immersion, is due for release in May and the band will be touring around the UK and Ireland to support it.\n   ",

He has been influencing guitarists all over the world since the 70’s, and today, he stands out as one of the all-time-guitar-greats, who actually managed to stay at the forefront of rock guitar for nearly four decades. Steve started playing when he saw The Beatles play live on a TV-Show. He was floored, and he instantly knew that the guitar could play so many styles of music that he just had to learn how to play. So, he formed a band, playing covers of Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Kinks, later on to Zeppelin and Cream, in which he became familiar with the basics of rock 'n' roll guitar! In the 70’s he co-founded the Dixie Dregs, and in the late 80’s he joined KANSAS when they reunited. Since 1993, he has been a full-time member of the legendary rock band, Deep Purple, and on the side, he has been the bandleader of a number of solo projects as well. So, Steve is definitely ‘still going strong’ – even after some four decades of touring, recording, performing and rocking! Impressive! \n      We asked Steve which TC Electronic products he uses. “Well, I have Nova Delay, PolyTune and my favorite – the new ‘TonePrint’ FlashBack Delay,” Steve says as he continues. “I also have a bunch of vintage TC Electronic pedals. Back in the old days, a friend of mine gave me this really great delay to try out. It was just really well put together and well designed, but it was hard to find back then.”\nSo, how does Steve utilize these pedals in his rig as well as during performances? “The tuner is my stage tuner because it has true bypass, and it is fast and easy to read in the dark or with the stage lights up,” Steve tells us. “The delay, finally I have ‘the one’. It sounds great because I was allowed to customize it exactly to what I wanted, plus it can be configured to give a 100% wet output. This means, for me, that I can use it to feed my wet amp – the same way I used to use huge digital rack mount delays for. My main thing is the modulation on the delay. Everybody seems to have forgotten about this, and I'm insisting that everybody tries my TonePrint preset and try and tell me that doesn't sound fantastic! My trick is to feed the delay from the effect send, but return it to a volume pedal, then to a separate wet amp... The delay has to be set so that there is no dry signal in the mix, which is no problem with the TC Electronic stuff. I have a box full of other pedals I've bought to try out, and none of them will do this. When TC makes the next pedal that I've asked for, I'll show you another neat trick that, again, nobody else is doing because none of the pedals give this capability. So, stay tuned!”\nFinally, we asked Steve about his overall approach to ‘living music’ as well as what his future plans are. “Well, my approach is to always try and please myself. I have no delusions that the music business will ever care what I do, so I have always been free to let my music be what it is without fear of rejection. People going to the shows have always fed me and my family, so the only constant I've had in my life is follow my conscience,” Steve says. “As for the future, I've got a lot going on, with a very special recording project with some great musicians that isn't quite finished. Plus, I'm doing some guest recording, and an appearance on Sharon Isbin's classical recording. Oh, and Deep Purple never stops touring, so I'm off soon!”\n   ",

            "desc": "About Steve Stevens\n          Steve Stevens is one of the most gifted guitarists to emerge from the ’80s music scene. Stevens picked up the acoustic guitar at only seven years of age and by the age of 13 he got his first electric guitar and was soon influenced by early progressive rock bands like Genesis, Yes and King Crimson.\n      It was in the early ’80s that Stevens hooked up with ex-Generation X singer Billy Idol. Idol found the perfect partner in Stevens, and Idol’s career skyrocketed, as he became one of MTV’s early video stars spurred on by Stevens’ inventive guitar work and outrageous glam rock image. Stevens is well known for his use of a raygun sound effect in the Billy Idol song \"Rebel Yell.\"This sound effect was, according to a Guitar World interview created by using a toy ray gun held up to the pickups. Stevens now uses a toy ray gun equipped with a pitch bender and a repeat changer to produce the sound effect.\n      Later Stevens played on recordings by Michael Jackson, Ric Ocasek and Robert Palmer among others. Additionally, Stevens appeared on the mega-selling 1986 soundtrack to the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun which earned Stevens a Grammy Award for Pop Instrumental Performance that year.\n      By the end of the´80s Stevens longed to launch his own solo career, and left Idol’s band. He soon formed his own group, Atomic Playboys. The early ’90s saw Stevens keep up his busy schedule, as he formed a new group named Jerusalem Slim. Stevens then signed on to work with ex Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil on 1993’s ‘Exposed’ tour as openers for that summer’s Van Halen tour. Numerous reviews stated that Steve was the best guitarist to grace the stage on many an evening.\n      Stevens finally got his chance to show off his lifelong appreciation of progressive rock when he united with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Terry Bozzio in the bombastic outfit ‘Bozzio, Levin, Stevens’, issuing a pair of releases: 1997’s ‘Black Light Syndrome’ and 2000’s ‘Situation Dangerous’. Around the same time, Stevens reunited with Idol.\n      In 2008, Steve released the critically acclaimed instrumental album ‘Memory Crash’ and in 2011, we will see Steve Stevens and Billy Idol celebrate a 30 year partnership that is stronger today than ever.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Soren Andersen\n          Soren Andersen is a Danish guitarist, producer and songwriter, located in Copenhagen, Denmark. He works as a touring guitarist for Glenn Hughes and Mike Tramp. He does most of his productions in the Medley Studios, which he co-owns. He has worked with artists such as Artillery, Jay Nash and Baal\n      Søren Andersen was destined to become a musician. He grew up in a home stuffed with musical instruments, and at age 8, he picked up the guitar – he never let go! Right after grade school, Søren headed out for a career as a professional musician, and that’s all he's been doing ever since. Today, he tours with Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple) and Mike Tramp (White Lion). Further, he has built up quite a reputation as a producer, and he is a co-owner of the ‘Medley’ studio in Copenhagen where he has played with and/or produced for e.g. Marco Mendoza (Thin Lizzy, Straitjackets, etc.), Tommy Aldrige (Ozzy Osbourne, Gary Moore, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, etc.), Artillery, Oliver Weers and Jay Nash.\n      Søren is a heavy user of TC Electronic products, and we asked him exactly what he uses as well as how he came across those products in the first place. “For my guitar rig, I use G-System, Nova System, Nova Drive, Octa Screamer and TC-Helicon’s Voice Tone Create, and in the studio, I use TC Electronic’s TDM Production Bundle for Pro Tools that includes the amazing reverb algorithms from System 6000 MKII,” Søren says and continues. “In my book, TC Electronic has always represented the best of the best, so I have always used lots of TC gear – from my Stereo Chorus Flanger pedal back in the 80’s to my current Nova Drive. TC Electronic is also responsible for the fact that I find it almost impossible to play without presets today – they have simply become part of my performance. Part of the explanation is probably that I am also a producer as I put a lot of effort into making my guitar sound as ‘correct’ live as it does in the studio. Whenever I switch sound, it needs to sound right – levels, no noise, no cuts of reverb or delay tails, etc. G-System and Nova System can do that, and that’s why I love them so much! Also, I never mix an album without using TC Electronic reverbs as they’re simply the best on the market!”\n      We also asked Søren which functionalities he liked the best. “Programmability,” Søren says promptly. “The programmable drive of Nova Drive and Nova System is unparalleled. Rather than having 3 drive pedals, I can do with just one and still have unlimited creative possibilities.” Since Søren is to be considered a ‘TC Electronic super user’, we asked him if had any ‘secret tips & tricks’ that he’d like to share. “Yes, plenty!” Søren replies. “Solder a stereo jack connector to a potentiometer in a Cry Baby pedal to make G-System’s Wah-Wah effect sound absolutely amazing. Another trick is to use Nova System’s Pitch Block for Slap Delay effects, which will allow you to use both a long tap-tampo delay and a slap delay in the same preset. Finally, try using the compressor in G-System as a booster before a drive. Choose ‘sustainer’ and set it to a slow attack and not too much compression, but plenty of level.”\n      Finally, we asked Søren if he has a certain philosophy or approach to music in general and what he has coming up in the near future. “Well, I consider every gig the last in my life! Never play like you don’t really mean it – you never know who’s in the audience! Also, I simply try to enjoy everything that music gives back to me, it is an essential anchor point in my life and it always will be. As for composition, if I have written a piece of music that I really like, it doesn’t matter that much whether others like it too. And when it comes to producing music, I don’t believe that there's such a thing as the ‘correct’ mix. It’s a matter of taste, so I just produce and mix music the way I like it, but I recognize that there are plenty of other solutions and that none of them are ‘wrong’ or ‘right’. And the future? I leave for South America with Glenn Hughes in December, release a solo album in early 2011, go to NAMM in January 2011 and, finally, I have a summer tour around Denmark with Mike Tramp in the calendar!”\n   ",

In the beginning of the 80’s he co-founded the underground band Sonic Youth. They brought a new element to the 80’s music scene as they explored unknown sonic territory with their dissonance, feedback and alternative tunings – effectively redefining the rock guitar sound. In addition to touring with Sonic Youth, Ranaldo has collaborated with and produced albums for artists like You Am I and Magik Markers. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Ranaldo the 33rd greatest guitarist of all time.\nAlthough mostly recognized for his role in Sonic Youth, this string bending, hard working multi artist holds an awesome collection of solo albums ranging from ‘From Here to Infinity’ released in 1987 to ‘Between the Times and the Tides’ released in 2012.\n      Lee Ranaldo plays on a whole lot of different guitars. He usually favors a Fender Jazzmaster, a Telecaster Deluxe or even a Gibson Les Paul. He is very fond of modifying and alternating the tunings of his guitars. For instance, he plays a Jazzmaster with a single coil pickup installed between the bridge and the tailpiece, to exploit the resonation chiming sounds on that particular area of the string. Also, in 2007, Ranaldo had Yuri Landman build the Moonlander guitar – a guitar loaded with no less than 18 strings total; 6 normal strings and 12 sympathetic strings.\n      To name a few, the Flashback Delay, the Dark Matter Distortion and the MojoMojo Overdrive have all earned their rightful place on the stomp-box shelf of this dedicated musician. The sheer versatility of these TonePrint pedals is appealing to even the most dedicated of musicians, ‘this pedal can do a lot of things […] I think one of the coolest things about it is the fact that it has this added aspect - that you can grab stuff off the net and download it right into the pedal and work with it’.\n      Luckily, Ranaldo agreed to meet up with our technicians and help us create a bunch of awesome Lee Ranaldo-style TonePrints for both the Flashback Delay and the Hall of Fame Reverb pedals.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Steven Wilson\n          Ever prolific English musician Steven Wilson has been hard at work at various musical projects, amongst others Porcupine Tree, over the last couple of decades, playing guitar as well as several other instruments while trying out different musical genres.\n      Steven Wilson has been exploring sonic expressions almost from the get-go. Heavily influenced by a musical diet consisting of his parents’ records, especially Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon and Donna Summer’s Love to Love You Baby. Wilson has later noted that listening intensely to those two records as a child has had a defining influence on his musical expression. \nAt the tender age of eleven Wilson got hold of a classical guitar and started playing around with its sound qualities, moving on to studio recording at age twelve when his father gave him a multi-track tape machine and a Vocoder. \n      Since those early days, Wilson has tried on many different musical clothings such as heavy prog, psychedelic, post-rock, electronica, drone, ambient music, metal and art rock. Most well-known for prog rock band Porcupine Tree, Wilson has also released music under names such as No man, Bass Communion, Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, and Blackfield, to mention a few. \n      The year 2008 marked a change, seeing Wilson release his first album in his own name. The 2008 album, Insurgentes was followed by Grace For Drowning in 2011, which showcases Wilson’s dedication to the album format, containing two cd’s.\n      As if that wasn’t enough, Wilson has also had his fingers on the buttons in the studio, becoming heavily interested in high-quality sound recording, which has given him a following among audiophiles. Therefore, it’s an honour that Wilson has chosen to turn to TC Electronic. Wilson states on using the TC Electronic G-System: \"My music requires a huge amount of different sounds and textures from the guitar, and this would normally involve a lot of different boxes and pedals. At the same time I'm a great believer in keeping things clean and simple on a long touring cycle, and the G-System has solved this issue perfectly, and been the centre of my whole setup for more than 5 years. It's been reliable, and proved easy to use and program on the fly, with quality effects, plus it also allows me to loop in 4 of my favourite pedals seamlessly. I can't imagine working without it.\"\n   ",

            "desc": "About Zoltan Bathory\n          Zoltan Bathory is the founder, guitarist and a major songwriter for the award winning LA metal band, Five Finger Death Punch. \n      Their debut album, The Way of the Fist, was released in July 2007 and has sold over 420,000 copies. Their second album, entitled War Is the Answer, was released in September 2009. The record sold over 44,000 copies on its first week of release and debuted #7 on the Billboard 200. All three singles off of the WITA cycle became top 10 hits, and the record sold over 300,000 copies in just 8 months. Further, Zoltan won the \"Best Shredder\" award at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. This award was the third Golden God trophy the band collected having already won the 2009 Best New Artist and 2010 Breakthrough Artist awards. With 6 top 10 singles under his belt, Zoltan is rapidly becoming one of the most successful songwriter/producers of modern day heavy metal.\n      When asked about his G-System Zoltan said… \n      “I started out with the original TC Electronic G-Major, but I then found out that the TC Electronic G-System can switch the channels on my head (Relay Switching). Now, I’m using all of the G-system effects. I loved the effects on the G-Major already, and it’s the same thing, but with all the extra features and the floor board. I said that if I was going to switch to this system, I would need something bulletproof and TC showed me that this was actually tank-proof!* My lead singer usually runs across my pedal board, so I figured if it could handle a tank it could probably handle Ivan too! He jumps on it nightly and throws water on it and so far, so good. It holds up nicely.\n      Besides the sound quality of the effects, a it’s a huge plus that I don’t have any gear in my rack anymore. I used to have all kinds of switchers and other stuff. Basically, right now I have this unit and it switches all my amps and it does everything that I need!”\n   ",

With incredibly complex arrangements often gliding over odd time signatures throughout and fast unison lines between John and keyboard player Jordan Rudess and the other musicians on stage, these gigs have become occasions for fans to admire musicians at the peak of their game. \n      And because Dream Theater is very much a musician's band, with each member demonstrating playing of the utmost skill and passion, it's no surprise that Petrucci has been regularly voted Guitarist Of The Year (most recently in Total Guitar magazine). His incredible technique and alternate picking style have also earned him invites into the upper echelons of the guitar-playing world. G3 is Joe Satriani's touring concept where he invites two of the best guitarists in the world to tour with him. With half a dozen of these tours under his belt, Petrucci has now been invited on G3 more than any other player. \n      Petrucci has a huge international fan base among hardcore guitar players and rock fans and he is often cited as one of the top 5 'shredders' in the world. That being said, when asked in a recent interview with TC about the one piece of advice he would give to an up-coming guitarist, his answer was not about technique but simply to \"be creative\". \n      It's no surprise that there are even forums and websites dedicated to John, the gear he uses and how he gets his unique sound with lists showing which gear was used on each of the Dream Theater albums and Petrucci's solo output. While his sound is very much about his unique playing style, Petrucci also takes a great amount of interest in his gear - naturally, he only uses the very best guitars and effects to polish off his sound.\n      With his own signature guitar series, it's down to TC Electronic to provide him with much of the effects and pedal power that he needs. Included in his arsenal is a TC Electronic SCF pedal, a 1210, three M3000's and a C400XL.\n   ",

He formed a new group “The Blue Line” and subsequently recorded some blues/rock albums that are among the finest of his career. \n      An important and essential component in Ford’s career is his passionate commitment to teaching.

            "desc": "About Brent Hinds\n          Brent Hinds is the lead guitarist and singer for technical hybrid metal band Mastodon.\n      Brent’s guitar sound is unique and easily recognizable. Playing the banjo as a child, Hinds learned his \"signature style\" of fast hybrid picking by emulating banjo fingerings on the guitar. He frequently utilizes the minor pentatonic, natural minor and the harmonic minor scales in his playing as well as many hammer-ons, pull-offs and legato slides.\n      Mastodon was formed in 1999, after Brent and Troy, who were in a band together, met the other members at a High On Fire concert and decided to meet up for a jam. They soon discovered that they had a common passion for sludge metal and the hard rock genre and decided to form a band.\n      Over the years, Mastodon has released the critically appraised albums ‘Remission’, ‘Leviathan’, ‘Blood Mountain’, ‘Crack the Sky‘ and ’The Hunter’ – of which the latter has sold over 75.000 copies in the US as of 2012 and reached number 19 on the UK album chart and number 10 on the Billboard 200.\n      Like the rest of Mastodon’s vocalists, Brent became a singer more by accident than by choice, when the original singer suddenly left the band and they were unable to find a replacement in time for an upcoming tour. Since then, the mix of different vocal styles has become an integral part of Mastodon’s unmistakable trademark sound.\n      In 2007, Brent Hinds and fellow Mastodon guitarist Bill Kelliher won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards for best shredders. In 2011, music magazines Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound all voted Mastodon's album The Hunter as best record of the year. Furthermore, BBC stated about Mastodon: ”They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of the Midlands in the 1970s.\"\n      While Hinds’ main focus is on Mastodon, he’s also pulling guitar and vocal duties for the surfabilly band Fiend Without a Face, and is also involved in other projects such as classic rock bands The Blood Vessels, West End Motel, Four Hour Fogger, The Last of the Blue Eyed Devils and, his newest project, the supergroup Giraffe Tongue Orchestra with fellow guitarist Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, former bassist of Jane's Addiction, Eric Avery and  former The Mars Volta drummer, Jon Theodore. Hinds furthermore composed the score for the movie Jonah Hex.\n      Mastodon is known to be heavy users of guitar effects and Brent’s impressive pedalboard of course includes several TC pedals, such as the Shaker vibrato, Corona chorus, Flashback delay and the Polytune.\n   ",

Dead End was re-united in 2009 in conjunction with a 20-year anniversary project, and they released their comeback album ‘METAMORPHOSIS’. They came up with their latest album ‘Dream Demon Analyzer’ in March 2012 and toured all around Japan after that.\n      Besides wielding the guitar in Dead End, Yuji has also released a total of two solo albums; ‘Psychial Island’ released in September 1990, and ‘You’s Alien’ released in August 2005. His résumé holds a never ending list of collaborations with legendary artists such as Japanese singer-songwriter Ryuichi Kawamura from the rock band Luna Sea and Japanese pop singer Nami Tamaki.

Pat Buchanan has played the axe in many parts of the US and abroad all his life.\n      Pat was raised in Jacksonville, Lake City and Talahassee, Florida. His parents were jazz musicians and his brother his own personal Rock Guru. So, growing up in a family of musicians, for Pat Buchanan to become a musician was always encouraged. He picked up the interest in the six-stringed weaponry over night and determinately started playing and practising the guitar with his older brother. The determination of this young hard rockin’ musician resulted in his first ever gig, when attending only fourth grade.\n      During the late 80’s and early 90’s, among others, Pat also recorded and toured with Cyndi Lauper. At the urging of producer Ed Seay, owing to the fact that Pat had many friends who worked all across the US, he decided to move to Nashville in 1993. He landed studio work quickly and has been successful as a first call session guitarist for many years. During this time, he played on many albums including hit records by Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Trace Atkins, Kim Richey, Rodney Crowell, Ray Davis of The Kinks and others too numerous to list here. Pat also won the 1996 ACM (Academy of Country Music) Guitarist of the Year award.\n      Besides this tremendous list of accomplishments and collaborations Pat Buchanan has also thrown himself into the world of solo careering. While staying in Nashville, he recorded a total of two records, ‘Pat Buchanan’ released in 2002 and ‘St. George’ released in 2005.\n      When he goes on stage, Buchanan is usually equipped with a certain set of sound effects – a very specific and dear armory to help ensure the crispy tone of his guitar. In this carefully selected palette of stomp-boxes we find the Corona Chorus, the Flashback Delay, the Vibrato Shaker and The Dreamscape - ‘I’m real excided about this vibrato pedal […] This Flashback delay is really impressive. It has the quarter notes, the dotted and the quarters and dotted right there on the preset.

Later, Jason relocated to Los Angeles as a session musician as well as a stint in the hard rock band BulletBoys. Hook became a highly coveted session player in the LA circuit, and he went on to tour and recording with acts like the Vince Neil Band and Alice Cooper. In 2007, Hook released his debut instrumental solo album Safety Dunce. It garnered industry praise and an L.A. music award for \"Best Instrumental Record\" of 2007. Later in 2007, Hook recorded his second solo release American Justice, which featured guest appearances from Alice Cooper, members of Five Finger Death Punch and Phil Demmel from Machine Head. \n      In early 2009, it was announced that Hook was joining heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch, replacing guitarist Darrell Roberts. On September 22, 2009, Hook and his new bandmates released the band’s second album, which was certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies in the United States and landed them a number 7 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \n      During March 2010, Jason and Five Finger Death Punch took time out of the busy tour schedule to travel to Iraq and play 10 shows to support the United States troops. \n      The band began to record their third studio album entitled American Capitalist in November 2010 at The Hideout studios in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The intelligent pitch shifting is one of the important reasons why the G-Major-2 is his weapon of choice. Here is what Jason had to say about it:\n      It’s really powerful and really smooth.

JD Simo blends the best elements of blazing, tasteful, authoritative country guitar with a great mix of the best of Cream-era Eric Clapton and a touch of Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac – with that recipe we are in for a full course meal in guitar heaven. \n      In the words of the legendary blues rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa “JD is one of the best out there right now!”\n      As a 4-year-old tot JD Simo was impressed by the movie The Blues Brothers and Elvis Presley so naturally he wanted a guitar in his hands. Growing up near Chicago blues clubs in the mid 1980’s, Simo caught the music bug early. By the age of 15 the highly determined Simo had already formed a band and released a live EP Burning Live that sold over 5000 copies. He quickly earned a strong local following in the Phoenix area. He spent most of his teenage years touring, either in his own solo endeavours or in various other bands.\n      In 2006 he moved his ambitions and hunger to Nashville and established himself as the lead guitarist in the Don Kelley Band. This band has been the main incubator for the best guitarist Nashville has to offer since prominent names like Brent Mason, Johnny Hiland, Guthrie Trapp and his now successor the fleet-fingered Daniel Donato. This led to a high demand on Simo’s skills and sound and he got employed as a high-class session musician. \n      In 2010 he joined his awesome forces with bassist Frank Swart and drummer Adam Abrashoff and formed the rock band SIMO. The band toured extensively and featured at several festivals including Mountain Jam and Bonaroo. Shaking of the demise of CDs, SIMO harkens back to the days when bands built followings not online, but night after night, show after show on stage.\n      SIMO like jam bands Phish and the Greatful Dead encourages fans to live-tape his shows and share them online, so fans of the band can share and recreate the live experience. \n      Not only is Simo sharing his musical gifts through live appearances and studio albums, he also maintains an online blog, featuring videos of his playing style as well as information about vintage music equipment as a nice side-dish to an already perfect meal        \n\n   ",

For the last 5 years he has played an eight-string guitar.\n      Like most guitarists Carpenter started out on a regular six string, but influence from bands like Fear Factory and Meshuggah led him to take up a seven string guitar in the late 90s. From 2010 onwards he kicked it up a notch with an extra string.\n“Why would you play less guitar, when you can play more guitar?” as he says.\n      As a true Californian, Carpenter grew up skateboarding. In fact, it was while recovering from a skateboarding accident he began to teach himself guitar at the age of 15. Bands such as Anthrax and Metallica formed his earliest influences. Although he has later stated that he now listens mostly to hip hop, he still lists Chaosphere by Meshuggah as his favourite album of all time.\n      Like his inspirations before him, Stef uses a lot of effects to achieve his sound. Among those effects are a range of products from TC. He has used the legendary 2290 Delay from TC for many years, and continues to do so. Lately he has really taken to the mini pedal series. The smaller the pedal, the more of them you can fit on your board after all.\nHe uses the Hall Of Fame Mini Reverb pedal, the Flashback Delay Mini, and the Corona Chorus Mini.

            "desc": "About Michael Britt\n          Michael Britt is probably best known as the twanging guitar player of the American country music group Lonestar.\n      Michael’s interest in music, and the guitar in particular, began when he was in his early teens. As Kiss came out with the ‘Destroyer’ album, the dream of every teenager – to take over the world as an axe-wielding musician – sparkled. When he finally discovered the awesome and legendary string-tapping equilibrist Eddie Van Halen, his mind was set.  Later on, he sought out inspiration through instrumental icons such as Mark Knopfler and Stevie Ray Vaughn.\n      Lonestar first charted in late 1995 with the single ‘Tequila Talkin', the first of the band's twenty-seven singles on the country charts. Nine of the band's singles have reached number one on this chart. Their biggest hit was 1999's ‘Amazed’, a crossover hit that reached number one on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first single to do so since Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's \"Islands in the Stream\" in 1983. The group has also recorded eight studio albums and a greatest hits compilation. Three of their albums have been certified gold, while three more have been certified platinum or higher.\n      When it comes to juicing up the sound of his guitar, Michael relies on a fair portion of sparkling stomp boxes from TC. The sheer versatility of the TonePrint pedals strikes Michael as the single coolest thing about them, ‘The fact that we are able to taper the feedback differently than the depth. It makes almost like three different pedals in one box, and I don’t think you can do that with any other pedal’.\n \nMichael is the type of musician who is always happy with his sound – a straight forward plug-and-play kinda guy rather than a ravenously knob-twisting sound tweaker. Thus, during a TonePrint session, we dialled in some of his favourite sound settings for the Corona Chorus, the Flashback Delay, the Shaker Vibrato and The Dreamscape and made them all available for some serious pedal-bank downloading.\n   ",

This legend has already left a massive mark on music history and continue to do so today!\n      Born in Britain, but raised in Brooklyn, New York by Caribbean parents with a big penchant for music, literature and art, Vernon Reid was basically raised on all the cultural wonders the world has to offer.\n      At home, Vernon’s parents played everything from American Motown music like James Brown to leaders of the British Invasion, The Beatles and Dave Clarke Five, and all the way to native Caribbean songs, which infused Vernon with a huge love for music early on. But it wasn’t before he heard the sweet singing sustain of Carlos Santana’s six-string magic that he knew that he just had to learn how to play the guitar.\n      From there a massive musical journey began, seeing Vernon diving deeper into the world of John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix while attending a jazz workshop at school. This workshop went on and changed his life forever, opening his eyes to how music can do more than just entertain. It can actually influence people, change minds and transform experiences. \nAnd that’s exactly what Vernon has been doing ever since through his music. The result being the legendary four-piece and funk-metal pioneers, Living Colour, founded by Vernon in 1984.\n      Living Colour became the canvas on which Vernon could paint with his multi-colored sonic strokes, creating a cult of diversity where everything was allowed. That’s probably why Living Colour sky-rocketed over night with their debut release “Vivid” containing the smash-hit “Cult Of Personality”.\nVivid was a melting-pot of everything Vernon knew and loved, which made jumping from hardcore punk riffs to catchy pop melodies, Delta Blues licks and jazzy solos as natural as breathing, and it quickly became the standard of reference within the world of alternative metal.\n      Living Colour managed to release three albums and receive two Grammy awards before they disbanded in 1995, but that didn’t put a stop to Vernon Reid’s inexhaustible creativity. \n      After the breakup, Vernon delved into a career as a solo artist and as a record producer for other acts, where the latter resulted in two Grammy nominations. Besides recording solo albums, Vernon also put his wide-ranging guitar skills to good use doing session work for artists at all ends of the musical spectrum like The Roots, Mick Jagger, Public Enemy, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Tracy Chapman and childhood idol, Santana just to mention a few.\n      In 2000, Vernon Reid and the rest of the Living Colour members reformed and subsequently released two albums in 2003 and 2009, while earning Vernon Reid a spot on Rolling Stone magazine’s 2004 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. \n      There’s no doubt that Vernon Reid has already solidified his status as a true guitar legend, and time will only see his sonic kaleidoscopic colors shine even stronger.\n\n   ",

Prior to joining Guns N’ Roses in 2002, Richard played with his band Pale Divine and toured as supporting act for Psychedelic Furs.\n      Richard Fortus joined the legendary Guns N' Roses in 2001 and toured with the band in 2002, 2006 and 2007, handling both rhythm and lead duties. He also played rhythm guitar on a little record called Chinese Democracy, which you may have heard of, and the following tour in 2009-2010. Band leader Axl Rose describes Richard as “an amazing lead player and a proven professional”. We got a chance to speak with with Richard, who has been using TC Electronic gear for quite a while\n      TC: So, how did your musical career start?\n      Richard: “My first band was called Pale Divine. We signed with Atlantic Records and put out one record with them. We toured supporting the Psychedelic Furs and during that tour, the Furs asked me to play with them. So I'd join them onstage after my band's set. Then after that tour, the singer approached me about starting a new band with him. That band was called Love Spit Love. We did two records together and a lot of touring. After that, we put the Psychedelic Furs back together and did another live record and some studio tracks as well as a live DVD. I was also touring with different artists and mostly doing session work in New York City and I also had a company that did music for films, TV, ads and video games. I then joined Guns in '02\".\nRichard is a firm believer in TC Electronic gear, which he uses both in the studio and live.\n      TC: What is your favourite TC Electronic gear?\n      Richard: “The piece of TC Electronic gear that I use more than anything in the studio is the FireworX. What an amazing tool that is! There is nothing else like it. Very unique and very powerful. Very, very deep and unique. I also really really love G-System. My tech (Rock Davis), turned me on to them. I don't use it with Guns, but I use it as the heart of my smaller rig that I use for everything else. When I toured with Rihanna, I used G-System along with a couple of additional overdrives and used G-System to switch channels on my Egnater modular preamp. The main piece of outboard gear in my rack is G-Major 2. I've been using G-Major's since I was in the Psychedelic Furs”.\n\"I began using the 2290 with my first band in the early 90's. It was THE delay to have!\" \n      \"G-System has become a very valuable piece of gear for me. I'm currently designing my pedal board for the Thin Lizzy tour around it. I'm going to be using the Nova Drive pedal with it, as well as a vintage Univibe and a tape echo and compressor. Probably just one old Marshall head this time. I'm really impressed with the Nova Drive. I've got quite a collection of all the boutique overdrive pedals over the years. I'm pretty amazed by how open and smooth sounding the Nova is and with the flexibility offered by integrating it with G-System, it's pretty unbeatable. TC Electronic stuff is laid out so intelligently and intuitively! Even the deepest units (like FireworX), make so much sense. You can go as deep as you want, but you don't have to always have the manual with you to program! The computer editing software for G-System is fantastic. It makes life so much easier! Absolutely brilliant piece of gear, I wish I'd had this years ago! Would have saved me so many headaches and dollars! It's a genius command center for any gigging guitarist\". \n      TC: Can you tell us a little about your future plans?\n      Richard: \"I'm currently scoring a movie and I am constantly employing Fireworx for ambient, sound-design layers. It's such an inspiring tool. I'm heading out on the road with Thin Lizzy in May. It's such an honor to have been asked to do that gig. They were such a huge influence on me and have such a legacy of brilliant guitarists. It's just such an absolute thrill for me to work with them. How cool is it to get to play all of those harmony leads with Scott Gorham!? I'll then head back out with GnR after that. I know we have confirmed Rock In Rio and a few other shows and are currently scheduling more touring. God, how lucky am I?! Sure beats the hell out of working!\"\n   ",

He has played and toured for A-list musicians including Alice Cooper, Billy Idol, Kiss and Black Label Society. \n      Derek Sherinian has made a true name for himself. He is a chameleon with an uncanny flexibility to work in various genres while maintaining his signature sound with his keyboard. He strives to work with the best within each genre and has succeeded doing so. \n      With Elton John as his first hero, Sherinian began taking piano lessons at the age of 5. He enrolled at Berklee College of Music and upon graduation landed his first professional gig with Jimi Hendrix band of Gypsys’ drummer Buddy Miles.  After the Miles gig, Sherinian’s old roommate from Berklee hooked him up with an audition to tour for Alice Cooper supporting Cooper’s platinum selling album “Thrash”. He got in and stayed for three years playing more than 250 shows. \n      Following his Alice Cooper tour Gene Simmons called Sherinian, asking him to join him on Kiss’s revenge tour in 1992. Working with pioneers Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons was an incredible experience for Sherinian but unfortunately hard rock was on a downfall in the mid 90s and the gig ended when the tour did. \nNonetheless, Shirinian did not rest long before luck struck him again. He auditioned for Dream Theater and was a key member of the group for four years. The group became the world’s most beloved progressive hard rock band since Rush. Sherinian played on three releases with the group before moving on. \n      In 2001 he joined Billy Idol’s band by recommendation from Idol’s guitarist Steve Stevens. Here he found a solid spot he enjoyed enough to stay and still be part of. \nAfter a decade with Idol, Sherinian was asked to record an album with Glen Huges, Jason Bonham and Joe Bonamassa.  This was the beginning of Black Country Communion. They released three albums and toured before disbanding where Sherinian went on and joined Joe Bonamassa’s solo band. \n      Since 1999, Sherinian has recorded seven solo albums, featuring performances by numerous highly acclaimed musicians. Sherinian enjoys playing in bands with others but uses his solo career to experiment and let his creative side loose. \n\n   ",

            "desc": "About Johnny A\n          With his unique blend of styles ranging from rock, jazz and blues mixed with a copious use of the guitars whammy bar, Johnny A has really managed to set himself apart from the rest of the guitar-wielding pack.\n      Johnny A got into music at the age of 6, where he started out playing the drums, but six years later he switched to the guitar after being exposed to British rock music like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Before taking the leap as a solo artist, Johnny worked as a 'side-man' for artists such as Doug Clifford from CCR, Mingo Lewis from McGlaughlin Santana, Bobby Whitlock from Derek and The Dominos and Peter Wolf from the J. Geils Band. In 1999 Johnny began his successful solo career, which is still going strong.\n      When asked about his musical inspirations, Johnny pays a lot of respect and credit to such legendary artists as Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Pat Martino, The Everly Brothers, and of course the before mentioned The Beatles and The Stones.\n      When it comes to guitar effects, Johnny is an avid user of the G-System, and was actually one of the original beta testers of the system during its development. When asked how he prefers to use the G-system, Johnny answered: 'I’m using it inline as a floor device, not as a convertible device. I like gear that’s part of a solution and not part of a problem. It’s a great solution to a lot of problems. The fact that it’s a switching system, a multi-effects processor as well as having loops where you can put in your favorite gain pedals is a Godsend. It has simplified my life immensely by using it!'\n      The main reasons why he likes the G-system so much is the great programming and switching options, which lets him jump seamlessly between different multi-layered effect setups, or even lets him do a 180 degree turn in style and effects if he wants, and all of this is possible just by pressing a single button.\n      Johnny A's effect philosophy is that the best effects are the ones you don't even notice are there, and this makes TC effects and the G-system the obvious choice for him, because as he puts it: 'TC products are very clean, very transparent. The way that they route within this box allows you to have a very, very non-muddied path so it keeps the source material intelligent.'\n      Johnny A is currently working on his next solo album, which is set for release in early 2013.\n   ",

In the 60’s he was a top R&B guitarist and the 70’s saw him as a top rockability guitarist with an immense aptitude for country music.\n      Having a musical father, who played an accordion and a piano, Albert was introduced to music from the early age. He, as a kid, first started playing the piano, but found the guitar to be much more intriguing and switched instruments.\n      At the age of 16, he became a real musical professional and joined the at that time best R&B band on English scene, the Thunderbirds. But after 4 years of being with the Thunderbirds, Albert found himself bored and left the band.\n      The next two years for Albert Lee were just passing by through several musical projects and names like Skeeter Davis, Bobby Bare and George Hamilton IV, as well as several bands and groups like Country Fever and Poet & the One man Band (a very popular live band in the UK).\n      His reputation grew and session work blossomed as he was invited to join Jerry Lee Lewis’s The London Sessions, which opened the door for reunion with 60’s American acts. This eventually led to the permanent position in the Crickets. The band cut three albums. \n      Lee received numerous offers for session work and in the mid 70’s Lee joined Joe Cocker’s Band for his album Stingray. This ultimately led to a solo album with A&M records that at the time were Cocker’s label.\nDuring the time Lee signed his first solo album he was also touring and recording a gig with Emmylou Harris’s Hot Band, that led Lee to postponing the release of his own album. He ended touring with the Hot Band to finish his solo album and in 1979 Hiding was released to the public. \n      Being a highly demanded musician, Lee scored a high-profile gig, which led to a five-year adventure with Eric Clapton’s band. Albert did not abandon his own solo career and continuously released several albums including his self-titled Albert Lee and instrumental releases on MCA, namely Speechless and Gagged But Not Bound.\nFrom 1983 until 20 years after Albert Lee was a guitarist and Musical Director for now retired band Everly Brothers.\n      Repeatedly voted “Best Country Guitarist” in the Guitar Player magazine Readers’  Choice Awards, Albert is a member of the Guitar Player  Gallery of Greats, an exclusive membership designated only to those who win the prestigious award five times.\n      Recently Albert has appeared at three of Eric Clapton's highly acclaimed \"Crossroads\" benefit concerts and was also featured in the Concert for George  live performance and film  in 2002. Currently working with Hogan's Heroes and Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings, Lee will soon be celebrating  his 70th birthday - and 53 years on the road - with a number of special concerts, both in the UK and US.\n   ",

With a professional career spanning five decades, Tommy has garnered hundreds of thousands of loyal fans worldwide on account of his breathtaking musicianship.\n      Give a listen to “Old Photographs,” the closing track on Tommy Emmanuel’s It’s Never Too Late, and you’ll hear the distinctive squeak of finger noise as he runs his hands across the frets of his Maton Signature TE guitar. Many musicians would edit those imperfections out, but to Emmanuel, those imperfections are perfect.\n\tA master technician, Emmanuel started professionally at age 6, rising through the ranks as a studio player and member of several Australian rock bands before he set off on a solo career. One of only five musicians handpicked by his mentor, Chet Atkins, as a Certified Guitar Player (CGP), he’s piled up numerous accolades, including two Grammy nominations, two ARIA Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (the Aussie equivalent of the Recording Academy) and repeated honors in the Guitar Player magazine reader’s poll.\n\tA noted fingerstyle guitarist,  Emmanuel frequently threads three different parts simultaneously into his material, operating as a one-man band who handles the melody, the supporting chords and the bass all at once. His talents, which translate in any language, carry him to the far corners of the globe, but Emmanuel never plays the same show twice, and he improvises big chunks of every date. That leaves him open to those technical imperfections, though they also provide some of the humanity to an other-worldly talent.\n      \t“It’s all about the feeling of the music,” Emmanuel says. “And it has to make me feel something. I’m still playing for myself, you know, because I figure if I please me, then I’m pretty sure I’m gonna please you. And that’s not an arrogant statement, it’s just quality control.”\n   ",

Especially the Flashback Delay, Vortex Flanger and Hall of Fame Reverb lets Andy achieve tones harking back to the days of The Police, whilst containing the modern sonic flexibility that keeps pushing his songwriting into exciting new territories.\n      The English multi-instrumentalist and composer Andrew James \"Andy\" Summers was born in Lancashire in 1942. In his early youth he took piano lessons, but decided to pick up the guitar in 1956 inspired by the strong musical current of the time. \n      At the age of sixteen he was playing the local clubs, and from his early 20s on he played with London based rhythm and blues bands such as Zoot Money's Big Roll Band, The Soft Machine and (for a brief time in 1968) The Animals.\n      After studying for five years at the California State University Northridge in the early 1970s, Summers returned to London. \n      In 1977 he joined The Police replacing original guitarist Henri Padovani. The Police quickly rose to fame, due to the ingenious synthesis of Stewart Copeland’s reggae rhythms, Andy Summers’ splashing guitar riffs and Sting’s distinct vocal.\n      As a member of the trio Andy Summers created some of the most seminal guitar riffs of all time, which helped define a whole new take on rock music. Some of his most acclaimed playing can be heard on songs like “Message in a bottle”, “Roxanne”, “Walking on the moon”, “Don’t stand so close to me” and “Every breath you take”.\n      In 1984, after seven years of touring and record sales around eighty million, The Police split up. During his time with The Police Andy won two Grammys for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. He was also voted the number one pop guitarist for five years by Guitar Player Magazine and was inducted into the Guitar Player Hall of Fame. In 2003, Andy's former bandmates, Sting, and Stewart followed suit, as The Police got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \n      Since The Police broke up in 1984 Andy has been very productive, releasing no less than twelve solo albums: “XYZ” (1986), “Mysterious Barricades” (1988), “The Golden Wire” (1989), “Charming Snakes” (1990), “World Gone Strange” (1991), “Synaethesia” (1996), “The Last Dance of Mr. X” (1997), “A Windham Hill Retrospective” (1998), “Green Chimneys” (1999), “Peggy’s Blue Skylight” (2000), “Earth + Sky” (2004), and “The X Tracks” (2005).\n      In 2007 The Police reunited for a brief period, embarking on what would become the third highest grossing tour of all time – a true testament to the impact of the group's music.\n   ",

He is known as a session musician but his musical career has spun widely including touring recording, arranging and producing several known for three decades.\n      Chandler got interested in music and arts at an early age and hearing Stravinsky for the first time as a child inspired his musical talent. Later on, hearing the Beatles on the radio while living in England in the early 60’s, boosted his interest in music.\n      Chandler´s biggest influence early on was Jimi Hendrix. What struck Chandler most was not Hendrix ´playing but the sounds he was able to create, especially the sounds heard on Third Stone From The Sun, EXP and the whole third side of Electric Ladyland.\n      In Bard College, where Chandler joined the AMDDFP (Art, Music, Drama, Dance, Film and Photography) division his interest in experimenting with music together with his humble personality shined through. Chandler quickly got acquainted and collaborated with inspiring people ranging from local artists to visiting professors on campus. After graduating from Bard, Chandler was already a known musician.\n      As a solo artist, Chandler has worked with acts such as Depeche Mode, Lori Carson, The Golden Palominos, The Psychedelic Furs, Grace Jones, Budgie and R.E.M on their album Automatic for the People. Chandler has also collaborated with Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode on his solo album Paper Monster. In addition, he has also recorded on two Cindi Lauper albums while working with her throughout a decade. Recent shows with Xpatsys (Robert Longo), J.G.Thirwell, Butterfly Percusion Parade (Budgie) and his long term association with Siouxie and the Banshees, The Creatures and Siouxie and the Dreamshow speak for themselves. \n      For the time being Chandler will continue to perform around NYC. He performs these shows where he plays live to videos he has created. Chandler processes video with the same aesthetic as he processes sound and tries to present the experience as a whole. Chandler also has plans to do more work with Budgie. They have some shows in Hong Kong including Talvin Singh and Damo Sazuki.\n      Chandler swears by the sound of his first TC Electronic product, the TC2290 Delay unit, which he has been using extensively for many years both in the studio for recording as well as on tour. Chandler agreed to create two TonePrints with us: one called the Toxic Verb Twister for the Hall of Fame Reverb and the other called Toxic Delays for the Flashback Delay, which reminds him of his trusty TC2290.\n   ",

He has been a member of three successful bands, had twice as many albums figuring on the US Billboard Top 200 and scored a 2 million $ recording contract with a major label before turning 40.\n      At the age of 15 Sune Rose Wagner formed the band “Western Front” that by 1992 had evolved into “Psyched Up Janis”. After three album releases the group split in 1999. After playing for a while in “The Tremelo Beer Gut” he formed his most successful band “The Raveonettes” with fellow Dane Sharin Foo.\n \nThe Danish indie rock duo combines pleasant two-part vocal harmonies with rough electric guitar sounds and considerable quantities of noise. Although the music is reminiscent of the careless rock of the '50s, there is a concurrent malicious texture to it, produced by the often obscure thematic of the lyrics (lust, use of drugs, suicide).\n      The duo met in Copenhagen and recorded their debut album, “Whip It On”, in 2001 with contributions from guitarist Manoj Ramdas and jazz drummer Jakob Hoyer. After releasing their debut album on the influential Danish Crunchy Frog label the band made quite an impression on Rolling Stone editor, David Fricke, at the Danish SPOT festival in Aarhus. Fricke’s positive review of the duo immediately resulted in a number of offers from major labels. A bidding war for the band started and culminated in a $2 million contract with Columbia Records in 2002.\n      “Whip It On” was named \"Best Rock Album of the Year\" at the Danish Music Awards in 2003, and in the same year Rolling Stone and Q Magazine proclaimed the group one of the forerunners of the \"Next Wave\" of contemporary music.\n      The band's first full-length album, “Chain Gang of Love”, was recorded in Denmark and in New York and is notable in that all the songs are in the key of B-flat major. Anders Christiansen (bass, percussion, organ) joined in for the recording of the follow-up album, “Pretty in Black”. The album featured guest vocals from Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes as well as guest instrumental spots from Maureen Tucker (The Velvet Underground). The duo's third studio album, Lust Lust Lust, was released in November 2007 in Europe and February 2008 in the U.S. The album received positive reviews. \n      In December 2008, Sune Rose Wagner released a solo album, simply titled “Sune Rose Wagner”. All of the songs are sung in his native language of Danish.\n \nThe Raveonettes' fourth album, “In and Out of Control”, was released in October 2009, with \"Last Dance\" as the lead single. “Raven in the Grave”, The Raveonettes’ fifth album, was released in April 2011 and has produced three singles to date. \nThe duo released their latest album, titled “Observator”, in September 2012, following the release of the two singles “Observations” and “She Owns the Streets”.\n      During live performances Sune Wagner uses a number of Jazzmasters. In the studio he also uses other types of Fenders besides several Gibsons, and Gretsches.\n   ",

For nearly 30 years his country-inspired heavy riffs and sublime soloes have been a key element in the group’s Cow-punk style.\n      In Copenhagen in the early 1980s, the band now known as D-A-D surfaced under the name “Disneyland After Dark”. The founding members were Jesper Binzer (vocal, guitar), Stig Pedersen (bass) and Peter Lundholm Jensen (drums). In 1984 Jesper’s younger brother Jacob Binzer was added to the group, bringing with him a set of guitar-skills that instantly elevated the band’s sound to previously unseen heights.\n      All the way from the early beginning, D-A-D has strived towards making music that is entertaining. Not entertaining in the sense the 1995 album title “Good, clean family entertainment, you can trust” would suggest – but entertaining in the sense the lyrics “wild sisters dancing all night round that totem” would suggest. Their fictionalized (often ironic) lyrics and colorful live performances have made their endeavors highly successful.\n      The band released its first album, \"Call of the Wild\" in 1986, but it was not until 1989s “No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims” and the hit-single “Sleeping my day away” that the group got its breakthrough. The album became the band's greatest success, and secured them a million dollar contract with Warner Music. A certain American cartoon-conglomerate, however, wasn’t too fond of the bands name, and so they had to abbreviate it to D-A-D. Under the new name the band achieved a fair amount of airplay, but in the end they chose to return and focus on the European market. In the late 1990s Laust Sonne replaced Peter Lundholm Jensen on the drums, and since then the lineup has remained the same.\n      D-A-D is an ever-present act at Danish festivals that wouldn’t be the same without the group. The band has toured all over the world and played thousands of live shows throughout the years. 11 studio albums, 17 singles, a million dollar contract and 10 tribute bands say it all.\n      Jacob Binzer plays a wide range of different guitars (although mainly Les Pauls) from which he seems to be extracting otherworldly amounts of sustain. Recently added to his pedal board is the TC Electronic Flashback Delay x4. \n   ",

His work with Queen and beyond over the last 40 years is virtually un-paralleled in the history of popular music, with the band having hit after hit album and singles, as well as sold out tours around the globe. Their legacy cannot be described fully in words, one can only admire their talent.\n      After the untimely death of Freddie Mercury in 1991, Queen went their separate ways for a while. Brian decided to focus on his solo career and in 1993, he published his first solo album, ‘Back to Light’, which was a sizable hit across Europe. In 2005, Queen was revived, this time with Paul Rodgers as the lead singer.\n      Brian has a proven talent as an excellent songwriter and guitarist and he has collaborated with numerous recording artists like Robbie Williams, Foo Fighters and Lady Gaga to mention a few. His past and present influence as a rock guitarist is a constant encouragement to artists around the world and we are extremely proud that an icon of Brian’s magnitude uses TC Electronic's flagship guitar effects processors to perfect his sound.\n      Pete Malandrone is the tech that sets and tunes all of Brian’s gear and we asked him a couple of questions about Brian’s rack:\n      TC: How did you hear about TC’s gear in the first place?\n      Pete: When I took over the tech responsibilities - after about a year of working mainly in the studio - I set about improving the guitar rig in as many ways as possible. One of the things that used to bug me was the 'glitching' in almost any pitch changer I tried. I nailed it down to processing speed, and then called a few people to see what they thought was the best and fastest guitar processor I could get my hands on. The name TC came up in a few conversations, so I got hold of one, and found it to be perfect for what Brian needed. \n      TC: How are you using the gear and how has it changed the way you work?\n      Pete: Once I got my head around the menus, I found that the G-major's were better than the gear I was using at the time for a lot of effects, not just the pitch shift stuff. I like the chorus, and now the G-major 2 has a longer delay time, I like that too. The main thing is I know them inside out and I trust them. I have never had to send one back and I have never had one go wrong on me. That counts for a lot in my line of work. You have to be confident in the equipment as well as the sound they make.\n      TC: What do you find most useful about the gear in terms of features?\n      Pete: The 'kill dry' option is brilliant for me. The way I run the rig makes it so important that I don't get any original signal to the effects amps. I really love that I can hit that button and know I don't have to scroll through pages of menus trying to find a bit of spurious dry signal from somewhere.\nThe 'phase reverse' option on the chorus is a great feature. It basically stops the phantom center of the effected stereo signal from interfering with the center dry mono signal in the three-amp setup we use.\n      Pete sums up that retaining Brian’s classic sound is the most important thing – and TC’s gear allows him to spike Brian’s tunes without tainting his tones with unnecessary processing noise or gain structures.\n   ",

TC Electronic gear has been an essential part of Peter’s rig for years now, and it helps him achieve the intense multilayered sonic universe that’s at the core of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club’s massive sound.\n      When Peter was 14 or 15 years old, he got in trouble and was grounded for over a year. He took his mother’s guitar and started playing, simply because he had nothing else to do. Peter’s mother taught him some flamingo and fingerpicking songs on her nylon guitar, which still influences his unique style to this day. Shortly after he started playing guitar he discovered Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd, and from that moment on Peter knew that his future belonged to rock n roll. In the process of copying the style of Hendrix, he used a lot of alternate tunings in order to sound as both lead and rhythm guitar, but he quickly discovered the impossibility in copying Hendrix and started focusing on creating his own personal style around the plethora of open tunings he discovered.\n      Peter met his future bandmate Robert Levon Been in high school, and they quickly started jammin’ together. But out of the blue Peter got a try-out with The Brian Jonestown Massacre, who needed a guitar player at that time. Peter got the gig and toured with them for a year, but he thinks his van was the main reason for the gig, since the band needed a van to get to South by Southwest (SXSW). \n      After being on tour with The Brian Jonestown Massacre for a year, Peter got back to playing with Robert which in no time led to the birth of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a reference to Marlon Brando’s motorcycle gang in “The Wild One” (1953). And as they say… from there the rest is history. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has recorded 7 studio albums and when their current tour is over, they’re heading back to the studio to record the next album. This band is unstoppable!\n   ",

Bill fulfills this task with excellence, churning out killer-riff after killer-riff like there is no tomorrow, with an originality, creativity and musicianship that’s quite a sight to behold.\n      Along with the rest of Mastodon Kelliher has been on a steady rise since forming in early 2000. They have become known for taking on ambitious concepts on their albums Leviathan and Crack the Skye that have been based on Herman Melville’s Moby Dick and on the idea of an out-of-body experience. \n      In 2007 Kelliher and Brent Hinds won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards for best shredders. In 2011 music magazines Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound all voted Mastodon's album The Hunter as best record of the year. Furthermore, BBC stated about Mastodon: ”They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of the Midlands in the 1970s.\"\nKelliher has mentioned being a fan of harmonized, layered guitar parts, relating it to playing rhythm along to albums as a kid, where he learned to focus on locking in on the rhythm. Hinds tells that Kelliher uses a lot of time and effort on coming up with the driving rhythms that push the songs forwards. Kelliher saves most of his ideas for riffs, noting that when revisiting interesting riff ideas he’ll often find the riffs not quite right, but that they often spawn new, more interesting ideas. We are thrilled that Bill Kelliher use the G-System and PolyTune Mini as part of his studio set-up and live equipment, helping him explore new musical ground.\n   ",

In 1999, Gore received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for \"International Achievement\".\n      Gore started his career playing in a local band called ‘Norman and the Worms’, but that didn’t pay the bills, so he also worked as a bank cashier. Nevertheless, in 1980 Depeche Mode was born and a new era for Gore was about to begin.\n      Depeche Mode was one of the first bands to establish their musical identity around the use of synthesizers and their dark and dramatic sound has made them stand out in the music industry. During the ‘80s the band shaped electronic music, taking it from early New Romantic to a darker and more intense universe. With hits like ‘Personal Jesus’, ‘It’s No Good’, and ‘I Feel You’, Depeche Mode took a confidant leap into the land of commercialism. They have sold over 100 million singles and albums worldwide making them the most successful electronic band in the world. \n      Gore not only plays the guitar in the groundbreaking electro band, he is also the author of many of the band's hit songs. Furthermore, Gore has put out two solo records ‘Counterfeit’ and ‘Counterfeit2’. Even though Gore is a talented songwriter, he has dedicated his two albums to other artists’ songs that he interprets into his own unique style. He has chosen songs – ranging from Iggy Pop to Kurt Weill – that have shaped his own sensibilities as a songwriter\n      In June 2011, Depeche Mode released a new album ‘Remixes 2: 81-11’ which is a tribute to their long and succesful career. On the record, different artists present their take on classics like ’Wrong’ and 'Puppets'.\n      We are very proud that TC Electronic is a part of Martin Gore's set up and we are looking forward to see Gore and Depeche Mode getting back on the road.\n   ",

She played lead guitar and violin with Scarlet Fever, the all-female backing band that toured with Cee Lo Green during 2010 and 2011. Convinced of her talent, Cee Lo green asked her to join his band permanently.\n      Sharon Aguilar currently plays in the original band Miss President consisting of members from the Cee Lo Green backing band Scarlet Fever. An accomplished and formidable guitarist, she attended the Musician’s Institute in Los Angeles and is also a classically trained violinist.\n      Aguilar has amassed a wealth of television credits in the United States and abroad, having played on Saturday Night Live, The Today Show, Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Lopez Tonight, Good Morning America, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Last Call with Carson Daly, The Colbert Report, American Idol, Later … with Jools Holland (U.K.), VH1 Storytellers and Fuse TV’s A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.\n      With Cee Lo Green, she has toured extensively worldwide, including opening for Prince at Madison Square Garden, opening for the Foo Fighters at Wembley Arena, the March 2011 SoundClash show in Las Vegas with the Ting Tings and Goodie MOB, as well as many festivals and private shows in the US and abroad. As a songwriter, Aguilar co-wrote “Rockstar,” which appeared on Fefe Dobson's album Joy from 2010. The song was also heard on American Idol and the CW Television Network’s Hellcats.\n \nAguilar’s love affair with TC started after learning that it is the brand Guthrie Govan depends on to get his impressive tones.\n      For her drive sound, she chose the MojoMojo Overdrive: “I have been into drive pedals of all kinds over the years and all of the other drive pedals I had all seemed to kill the bottom end. I can get a super silky tone with the MojoMojo and not only does it not kill the bottom end, it is not over-compressed and can still stand alone in a live mix.“\n      “I love the voicing switch on the MojoMojo. It feels so good when I pick. It is very responsive, and it is silky smooth. I can switch between two voicings that are very unique vintage drive sounds that keep all of the frequencies that I don't want to lose.”\n      Aguilar needs her delay pedal to cover a lot of ground and chose the Nova Delay for this challenging task. “It is probably the best stand-alone delay pedal on the market. I can't think of another delay pedal that size that can do everything the Nova can. Plus, it sounds so organic and smooth and it doesn't take anything away from your tone or color the sound in any way, that makes it feel awkward or overbearing.”\n\n   ",

The list of artists he has worked with through the years is endless, but he is most famous for wielding the guitar with bands such as Queens of the Stoneage and Eagles of Death Metal\n      Dave Catching is best known for his work with The Queens of the Stone Age and The Eagles of Death Metal , but he has been playing with many different bands in genres such as Desert Rock, Stoner Rock and Garage Rock Revival. Well, most kinds of ‘Rock’ actually. Dave grew up in a musical family and his brother, Jack, taught him to play the guitar. Over the years, Dave played with tons of bands, and one day he was offered to go to Europe on a tour as guitar tech for a band called Kyuss. He became close friends with the band, and when the band broke up a few years later, Joshua Homme that played with Kyuss and Dave started playing and recording together as Queens of the Stone Age. After three years, Dave went on and focused on playing with 'earthlings?', which was a project that had been started years back. Later, in 2003, Dave started playing with Eagles of Death Metal. Along the way, Dave also established a recording studio with a friend and sound-engineer, Fred Drake, that used to record his bands. They own the ‘Rancho de la Luna’ studio in Jushua Tree, California, so Dave is also into studio gear and producing music. We asked Dave about his TC Electronic products. “My TC 2290 Digital Delay is always in line,” Dave says. “Back in 1993, one of the first pieces of gear that Fred and I ever bought was a used 2290. I use it a lot on vocals, although I do love it for guitar and keys just as much. It’s always crystal clear, always sounds great and it’s so reliable – never had a problem. I seriously love it, and since it's been reliable for so long, it lead me to try many other TC Electronic products. I have never been let down, and all of my TC products find use at my studio and for live performances. For instance, I use TC reverbs and my RH450 bass rig a lot in the studio. Plus, I have all the TonePrint and Nova pedals, and I use them during almost every session for guitar, bass, keys, etc. Someone always finds a cool use for them. When it comes to my live setup, I just love the new Flashback Delay and the amazing PolyTune tuner never leaves my board.”\nSo, how about an overall approach to playing and recoding music? “My overall approach is to get everything nicely mic'ed up, set a nice vibe and just go with the flow,” Dave says. “The vibe always wins over the technical side. If you can achieve both, that's the best, of course, but first of all, you want everyone comfortable and into it. Also, I love experimentation, and I really enjoy bringing out all the pedals and plugging them in to find sonic landscapes that might otherwise go uncharted.”\n   ",

He spits out deep and versatile albums en masse and always delivers top quality music. \n      Devin Townsend began hos musical career by performing in a number of metal bands in high school. He was discovered by a record label in ’93 kickstarting his role in the music industry. His discovery led to him performing lead vocals on Steve Val’s album “Sex & Religion” followed by touring with him as well. Townsend was outraged by the music industry and vented his anger on a solo album released under pseudonym ‘Strapping Young Lad’.  \nTownsend assembled a band under the same name and released 4 studio albums until he went solo.\n      Townsend has an amazing variety in his musical style. He works in ranges of hard rock, progressive metal, new age and ambient. As a solo artist he has had a lineup of various artist working on his albums sporting his infinite variety. \nIn 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend band with a dedicated lineup. Under the Devin Townsend band he recorded and toured for two albums. \n      In 2007 Townsend needed new scenery. He disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend band and took a break from music for two years. \nWhen he revisited his music career it was with the founding of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums each written in a different style and released between 2009-2011. Afterwards he kept to the Devin Townsend Project and keeps releasing under this name. \n      Across all Townsend’s bands and projects he has released twenty studio albums and three live ones. Similar in all off these are his versatile vocal delivery that ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing. The same diversity appears in his writing. Townsend’s musical style has roots in metal but draws elements from other genres into the material. Each album is written to express different aspects of his personality. \n      Besides being a musician Townsend started HevyDevy records with his wife Tracy almost twenty years ago. Originally the company was founded to distribute his album “Ocean Maschine” but it has grown to be so much more. \n   ",

His unique style and lyrical phrasing have solidified his position as one of the best within his genre, and have seen him collaborate with several jazz/fusion legends throughout his career.\n      Growing up in the small village of Bilthoven, Netherlands nothing pegged young Richard Hallebeek to become what he is now. Namely one of the greatest voices within the world of progressive jazz and fusion guitar. His parents weren’t musicians, and even though they heard a lot of The Beatles and Frank Zappa at home, none of these huge innovators would become what tipped the musical scale for Richard. Instead it was the ubiquitous music show “Top Of The Pops” that saw lightning strike with Richard at the age of ten after witnessing energetic performances by Toto and Talking Heads on the show.\n      From that point on, there was no stopping him. Richard took up guitar instantly and became a self-proclaimed “total guitar-nerd”, dedicating every waking hour to the art of the six-string. He dove deep into the intricate and virtuoso guitar playing of Pat Matheny, Allan Holdsworth and Eddie Van Halen all while still maintaining a deep-rooted love for the catchy tunes of The Beatles. At age 12, Richard was already performing with various local jazz and rock outfits, and at the age of 17 he officially became the youngest guitar player ever to be accepted into the highly respected Hilversum Conservatory, where he studied with jazz legend, Wim Overgaauw.\n      He graduated with a master’s degree in jazz, composition and improvisation. Not known to be standing still for too long, Richard decided to evolve his skills overseas by taking a one year course at the world renowned Los Angeles Music Institute, where he would find himself studying with none-other than Scott Henderson, Brett Garsed and Dan Gilbert.\n      Besides seeing his guitar skills rise to new levels of excellence, Richard’s trip across the pond also taught him a valuable lesson. No matter where you live, you can’t wait on your lucky break, you have to make things happen yourself!\n      This level of drive and dedication saw Richard Hallebeek record his critically acclaimed debut album “Generator” together with legendary guitarists Frank Gambale and Carl Verheyen, and former class mates Scott Henderson and Dan Gilbert.\n      From thereon Richard has gone from strength to strength acting as everything as an in demand session player, writer for the popular Dutch music magazine “Music Maker”, and the orchestrator behind his own ambitious music venture called the Richard Hallebeek Project, where his ultra-creative compositions has seen guest appearances by iconic guitarists such as Shawn Lane, Andy Timmons, Greg Howe, Guthrie Govan and Eric Gales.\n      Richard is a grand musical collaborator, and there’s no doubt that his lyrical phrasing and spine-tinkling tones will grace several recordings to come.\n\n   ",

He is regarded as an iconic figure in the world of music and beyond. \n      Stewart’s musical career alone spans more than three decades. Behind the scenes, he has produced albums and co-written songs for Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Bono, Sinead O’Connor, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, Jon Bon Jovi and many others. Stewart has been honored for his work by winning numerous Producer, Songwriter and Grammy Awards on his musical path. One of his greatest musical achievements counts the collaboration with Annie Lennox in the groundbreaking pop-rock group Eurythmics with whom he sold more than 100 million albums. \n      Described by Bob Dylan as a fearless innovator, Stewart and his company 'Weapons of Mass Entertainment' have been at the forefront of innovation linking creative ideas to projects in film, television, books, theatre and new media.\n      Born David Allan Stewart in 1952 in Sunderland England. In his teens while living in London, he got a record deal for his folk rock band Longdancer, without achieving any commercial success. In late 1976 Stewart got introduced to Annie Lennox but it was not until 1980 that Lennox and Stewart went on to launch Eurythmics. The band´s global breakthrough came with the release of their second album 'Sweet Dreams' (Are Made of This) in 1983.\n      Around 1989, after releasing eight studio albums, Eurythmics disbanded without any official notice and Stewart began writing film soundtracks. A year later he achieved international success with the instrumental track 'Lily Was Here' featuring saxophonist Candy Dulfer for the Dutch film 'De Kassière'.\n      In the early '90s Stewart formed a band called 'The Spiritual Cowboys' who went on releasing two albums. In between mid and late '90s Stewart also managed to release two solo albums entitled 'Greetings from the Gutter' (1995) and 'Sly-Fi' (1998), which was released on the Internet exclusively.\n      In the years to come Eurythmics reunited a few times under different circumstances, but Stewart continued along his own creative path. In 2002 he was the driving force behind the Nelson Mandela 46664 campaign for which he recorded few songs together with Paul McCartney, Bono and Edge of U2. Linking his musical talent and inspiration to charitable causes Stewart also organized campaigns against HIV/AIDS and got involved with Greenpeace.\n      Not surprisingly, for the past few years Stewart has been busy. He co-produced and co-wrote the new Joss Stone and the new Stevie Nicks record 'In Your Dreams' with whom he went touring. Stewart has also recently formed a group called SuperHeavy consisting of an interesting line up of musicians from different genres counting Mick Jagger, Joss Stone, A.R.Rahman and Damian “Jr Gong” Marley.\n      In 2010 Stewart went to Nashville Tennessee to record his latest solo album 'The Blackbird Diaries' including duets by Stevie Nicks, Martina McBride among other artists. Currently Stewart and Stone continue to join forces in yet another concept; 'The More Love Tour' inviting special guests along the way. Not to forget, Stewart recently collaborated with Glenn Ballard for writing Ghost the Musical that showed in London and is scheduled for Broadway this year.\n   ",

He has been playing since he was 3, and gigging steadily since 13 or 14.\n      He grew up in a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and at 12 years old he was already playing in the established professional venues like the Musicians Exchange Café in Fort Lauderdale. He quickly caught the ears of patrons and other musicians alike.\n \nWhen Josh was 13, his talent also caught the attention of Don Cohen, owner of the Musicians Exchange Cafe, who offered to manage him and help develop his career.\n \nJosh’s young age may have helped Don Cohen open a few doors, When a lot of the blues greats passing through the club thought it might be fun to have the local young guy sit in on a couple of sessions. However, it quickly became apparent, that Josh Smith was more than a novelty. His chops and sheer talent were undeniable. That led him to becoming the lead guitarist in local blues band The Rhino Cats at the tender age of 13. The band became very popular in South Florida in the following years, and even won a Florida Jammy Award as best blues band.\nWhile playing with The Rhino Cats, Smith also found time to publish his first two solo albums, when he was 14 and 15 years old.\n \nAfter graduating High School, Josh went touring with his newly formed band, Josh Smith and the Frost. During the next few years, Josh Smith and The Frost completed several national tours, and recorded a couple of CD’s.\n \nIn 2002, he relocated to Los Angeles with his wife. They still live there with their two children.\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Josh has transitioned somewhat. He still plays solo and still releases  solo records but he also works as a popular sideman guitarist. In that capacity, he has completed two national tours with American Idol winner Taylor Hicks, and since 2008 he has played with R&B legend Raphael Saadiq.\n \nJosh’s playing is very articulate. He really wants you to hear the notes coming through. He favors precision over speed, which leads to a very clean sounding style, that has led some fans to call his playing “perfect”. Many note his incredible tone as one of the defining characteristics of his music.\nWhen it comes to the playing you’re on your own, but the tone — that we can help you with, with The Flashback Delay, and the Toneprint feature.\n   ",

After this victory, Omar embarked on a musical, spiritual and physical journey - traveling the world, studying Cuban and Andalusian gypsy music. Learning from the Cuban and Spanish musical masters such as Carlos del Puerto, Jr. and Juan Serrano, Omar immersed himself in classical and flamenco guitar. Living the life of a gypsy, he eventually found himself coming full circle back to his American music roots. Omar describes his music as equal parts rock, Latin, Delta blues, atonal classical and performance art. His heritage is as diverse as his music, ranging from Basque (via Mexico) to Norwegian, Native American and Russian roots.\n      This remarkable versatility caught the ears of Tom Waits who chose Omar to be his guitarist for the Glitter and Doom tour. His music now reflects these various experiences, revealing a multi-dimensional artist that is rare in today’s music scene.\n      Besides Tom Waits, Torrez has shared the stage with musical giants such as Kinky, the Buena Vista Social Club, Jethro Tull, Pancho Sanchez, Susana Baca, Mumiy Troll, Francisco Aguabella and Viola Trigo, as well as underground favorites Indigenous, B-side Players and Sidestepper.\n      When asked about his TC gear, Omar said…\n      After schlepping around heavy pedal boards and suffering through broken pedal cables and malfunctions throughout my tours and gigs, I began to try out various multi-effect pedals and was not impressed. Then I heard the TC Electronic stuff at a friend’s studio and was blown away. The NOVA System has analogue drive circuitry, warmth and versatility without sucking your tone away. PLUS, it can operate on European current as well. Now, no matter where I travel, whatever amp or PA system I endure, I always have my tones, without hassle, in a well-built box. That, together with the MojoMojo Overdrive and Polytune and I am set. Thank you TC!\n\n   ",

In fact he has played with several legendary blues guitarists and is fast on his way to becoming one himself.\n      Kirk Fletcher started playing the guitar when he was 8, inspired by his older brother Walter, who he still lists as his single biggest inspiration. For years, until Kirk was in his early twenties, they played several times a week in their fathers church. In high school he played with a lot of gospel and R&B groups. But underneath it all blues was always his true love.\n      That love, and Kirk’s unquestioned talent and work ethic has led him to be hailed by some as the world’s best current blues guitarist. Besides being a sought-after sideman guitarist, Fletcher spent many years as part of several bands, perhaps most notably the legendary blues rock band The Fabulous Thunderbirds between 2005-2008.\nSince leaving the Thunderbirds he has released a very well received solo album with his own band. The album, My Turn, marks a couple of interesting changes for Fletcher. He started writing a lot of the songs, as well as singing them himself. He never really sang before, so he thought he should get a singer. He had a hard time finding a singer he liked but was reluctant to take on that role himself. \n“A lot of my friends were saying, Man, just try it. Just sing one song. And so I just tried it. Now I’ve really started to enjoy learning to sing. It’s almost becoming my main thing.”\n      For fans of Fletchers guitar playing that might sound a little scary, but he assures us, that he’s still learning something new every time he picks up the guitar. He continues to pick it up every day, so the best from Kirk Fletcher should still be ahead of us.\n      Fletcher doesn’t use many effects in his setup, preferring the sound of a good clean amp cranked up to high volume, most of the time. Liking a good clean, bright tone, with just enough gain to make the note speak, as he says. However, he does profess his love for an awesome reverb, like the Hall of Fame Reverb from TC.\n“Reverb is probably my biggest crutch, because it just feels good to have reverb. I guess I’m kind of a reverb junkie”\n   ",

To everyone else he has been the lead guitarist, songwriter and one of the driving forces behind heavy metal Hall of Famers Metallica since 1983.\n      Although Hammett is best known for his axe-wielding inferno for Metallica over the past 28 years, it should also be noted that he is an influential and founding member of thrash metal band Exodus, with whom he rocked for three years. In fact, Exodus opened for Metallica in late ’82 and ’83, making a move to Metallica seem like it was destined to happen for Hammett. \n      Over the years he has added numerous awards and recognitions to his name, which have included personal awards such as being included in Rolling Stone’s ‘The Top 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time”.\n      As far as achievements go with Metallica, Hammett has contributed to 9 studio albums, three live albums, five extended plays and 45 singles. The band can also boast nine Grammy Awards (out of 18 nominations), and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the first band to do so. Adding to all of this, he helped Metallica propel themselves out of the underground scene and into the spotlight of heavy metal. To date, Metallica has sold more than 100 million records featuring classics such as “Enter Sandman”, “One” and “Nothing Else Matters”.\n      Beyond their commercial success, Metallica and Hammett have become an inspiration for countless musicians extending beyond their own heavy/thrash metal genre - for example, the four cellists who make up Apocalyptica. Metallica has been said to be responsible for re-shaping and injecting a much-needed boost of energy to heavy metal.\n      Hammett has an extensive collection of guitars, but is especially known for his long-time love affair with ESP guitars - a mutual love which has spawned several Kirk Hammett signature models, mostly centered around a super-strat design. \n      Kirk’s been using TC Electronic gear since the old days as well, choosing the precise tonal shaping options of the TC Electronic Dual Parametric Equalizer to achieve his crushing tone. Not only did Hammett use the Dual Parametric Equalizer live during the early days, it was a staple of his tone during the recording of the 1984 classic Ride The Lightning album, shaping the famous lead sounds on the album that cemented Metallica as leaders of the thrash movement.\n      Kirk Hammett is definitely a musician who uses a wide array of effects although he prefers a rack setup that is controlled sidestage by his guitar tech. This is where we can proudly say that he had the TC Electronic G-Major as part of his rack setup for a number of years. This road-worthy workhorse has since been replaced by the upgraded and refined G-Major 2, released in 2009.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Scott Ian\n          Scott Ian has helped pioneer the soaring sound of thrash metal band Anthrax with his crunchy guitar riffs. Over the last 30 years, he’s worked on creating the “New Wave of American Heavy Metal” and has been a constant figure in the world of music, comics, poker, movies and television. \n      Born and raised in Queens, Scott Ian fell under the spell of Kiss early on and as a result, became interested in playing guitar. By the early 80s, he took to the new wave of the British heavy metal movement, looking up to bands like Motörhead, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. He was determined to form a band in that style and sure enough, more than 30 years ago, he founded Anthrax, a band that was to become a thrash metal icon alongside groups like Metallica, Slayer and Megadeath. \n      The band’s first release, 1984’s “Fistful of Metal” brought on quite a following and Anthrax soon made a reputation as one of the world’s top thrash bands on the strength of classic metal releases: 1985’s “Spreading the Disease”, 1987’s “Among the Living”, 1988’s “State of Euphoria”, and 1990’s “Persistence of Time”. \n      Although they had set the norm for thrash metal, Ian and his band mates aimed to innovate and created two metal subgenres thought to be “off-limits” until then. They first broke down barriers and merged metal with hardcore in Ian’s project called Stormtroopers of Death releasing masterpiece Speak English or Die. The second novelty was combining metal with rap in their groundbreaking collaboration with Public Enemy, “Bring the Noise” and “I’m the Man”. \n      The group’s ensuing albums retained the band’s loyal following especially due to their touring efforts – they’ve been dubbed ‘touring pros’, having had over fifty tours worldwide, in thrity-two countries, on five continents. \n      In 2009, Anthrax completed a run of European venues including Metallica’s Sonisphere festivals in Germany and UK. A year later they returned to the same festival where for the first time ever the Big Four – Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeath -performed together on the same stage for seven historic shows.\n      Ian also plays guitar in a band called Pearl who just completed two tours with Velvet Revolver and Meat Loaf. In addition, he co-founded The Damned Things in 2010 with Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley of Fall Out Boy, Keith Buckley and Josh Newton from Every Time I Die and Anthrax band mate Rob Caggiano. In 2009 they released “Ironiclast”, a hard-rock album boasting influences from all three bands resulting into a fascinating medley: the melodic fetchiness of FOB, the heavy technical moments of ETID and the powerful riffing of Anthrax. \n      Apart from focusing on Anthrax as full time career, Ian also made time to star in a 2001 VH1 television gig hosting ‘The Rock Show” and followed up with shows like “Behing the Music” and “SuperGroup”. He’s also worked on DC comic series featuring their iconic character Lobo and has signed with Ultimate Bet to be one of their online professional poker players. Just recently, Ian and Anthrax have released their tenth studio album, titled “Worship Music” and have already started touring with a fully booked calendar for months to come.\n      TC Electronic caught up with Ian as he was preparing for a show, just before NAMM 2012 and got a chance to talk to him about his gear and his signature sound. We were honored to hear that our Classic Booster Distortion pedal has been part of his rough eclectic sound and his anti-gravity riffs ever since the ‘80s. “I’ve been using TC since probably around ’82, ’83. I was using that booster distortion pedal when I first got my GCM800 back in ’82. The secret to my tone was that TC box. I used it to boost the signal going into the amp - it gave it the edge and the low-end and everything I needed without it being too fuzzy. It sounded so much better. ”, Ian explained.\n   ",

            "desc": "About Brian \"Head\" Welch\n          Brian “Head” Welch is the founder of Love and Death, Co-founder of KORN and a true metal head by heart. He has inspired many with his marvelous skills on the guitar. \n      As a child Welch originally wanted to play drums. We can all thank his father for persuading him otherwise by pointing out the difficulty of carrying around a drum kit. If he hadn’t, KORN might not have the distinctive sound that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid 90s. \n      In 1993 something awesome happened for Welch. The band L.A.P.D was looking for a new guitarist. They collaborated with Welch and formed the band creep. It was not the final-version band because soon after singer Jonathan Davis joined and KORN was born. KORN reached massive success and became one of the top-selling hard rock groups. Welch stayed in the band for 12 years before deciding to change his scenery. He released the deep and emotional album “Save me from myself” under his own name. It was a tough beginning for Welch as he completely had a fresh start. He was used to playing live gigs in front of thousands yet with his new project he played for just hundreds. In 2012 Welch decided to separate his business in two. His book releases and public speaking’s remained under “Brian Head Welch” and he re-branded his solo-project with the band name “Love and Death”.\n      After 7 years on his own without much contact with his previous band members from KORN, Welch appeared in a show with them in May 2012. This led to him appearing with the band in more shows and finally in May 2013 Welch rejoined the band officially. He did not abandon Love and Death but works simultaneously with both projects. \n      In addition to making must-hear music and writing inspiring books Welch is the principal organizer and representative of The Whosoevers. An outreach organization and product-line founded with Sonny Sandoval (P.O.D) and Ryan Ries. The organization is set out to build and strengthen the youth of today, inspiring their creativity and stand together to make a difference. Welch has the intent to positively impact today’s music, skateboarding and art culture.                            \n\n   ",

            "desc": "About Pete Thorn\n          As a studio guitarist for producer Linda Perry, Peter Thorn has played on albums by Courtney Love, Alicia Keys, Daniel Powter, Ben Jelen, and others.\n      And with G-System as an integral part of Peter’s touring setup - so far it has delivered rock solid performance at 150+ worldwide live concerts with Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave) - chances are that you’ve already heard Peter’s\nG-System live in action or on your favorite album.\n      Between this impressive number of concerts and extensive sessions in Linda Perry’s incredible Toluca Lake studio, Kung Fu Gardens, Peter has really gotten into the ins and outs of his G-System. He fell so hopelessly in love with the integrated effects management system that one unit just wasn’t enough; he’s granted himself the luxury of one for his touring setup, one for studio work and a back-up unit just in case. \n      It’s not a feature – it’s the future\nToday’s DSP technology allows us to pack the renowned TC processing power and sound quality into just one convenient floor-based unit - a performance level that previously took a whole bunch of dedicated rack units to achieve. An increasing number of touring musicians have turned their backs on traditional rack setups and gone for the portable convenience of G-System - artists you’d expect to have enough road crew, stage hands, guitar techs etc. to handle whatever heavy equipment they may carry along on tour. So there’s more to it than portability.\nPeter Thorn nails it: “I am not a \"dance on pedals\" kind of guy. Since the mid-1990s I’ve been using loop switchers to control my pedals, while incorporating rack effects units for their MIDI- switching abilities and quality of reverb, delay, and modulation sounds. I want, and have grown accustomed to, the ability to hit one button on the floor and have EVERYTHING change, my amps, effects, everything. My G-System rigs give me that kind of programmability, great sound and versatility in a pedalboard format- it’s a one of a kind product!” Commenting on the easy setup he continues, “I feel really confident that I can do any gig and session now with just my G-System, whereas before I needed at least my 6-space rack and former pedalboard to make things happen. The\nG-System has worked flawlessly for over 150 Chris Cornell shows, so I have no worries about reliability. I know it’s dependable night after night in front of thousands of people. The sounds are going to be there, it’s going to translate to the crowd, and it's built like a tank so I don't need to worry about it breaking down on me!”\nThere are probably quite a few stage hands out there welcoming this trend.\nIn the studio, time is money\nG-System has also proven really effective for Peter’s studio work. Besides having great ears for spotting the right sound, the perfect take, creative rearrangements etc. every studio owner’s concern is something as pragmatic as time. When you hire in session musicians for a project the last thing you want is to waste everybody’s time. The faster/easier studio musicians achieve the sounds the recording artist and executive producer are after, the better. Also in this respect, Peter has experienced just how easy G-System gets the job done. “I often need to get great sounds quickly. I once A/B’ed running through the G-System rig and just running straight into the amp in the live room through 40 feet of cable. The difference was spelled out and everybody got it right away - it sounded absolutely natural and there was no loss of signal when I used my\nG-System rig on a totally dry preset, because it’s all buffered, and I could of course then add effects to taste (I love the Vintage Phaser which I've been able to closely simulate the sound of my vintage mxr phase 90 with) and switch between different amps on the fly, etc. It allows us to track so much faster and with great sounds, all presetable and instantly recallable of course! “\nEnvironmental bonus\nAnd hey, it's a good feeling to play overseas shows like Earth Day knowing that I no longer bring a huge rack of effects on the plane - sort of my humble contribution to lowering co₂ emissions\" Peter Thorn adds. Of course all of G-System’s manufacturing procedures are RoHS compliant, meaning that not only has TC implemented lead-free soldering, but components provided by suppliers also meet the requirements specified in the RoHS Directive on restriction of hazardous substances. So rest assured that on top of taking your talent to a level you never thought possible, G-System will up your environmental-friendliness.\n   ",
